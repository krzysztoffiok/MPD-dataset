__label__time	Not all attendees arrived on time
__label__recommendations	For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed.
__label__recommendations	The simple facts should be so much more convincing!
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't fall asleep but I was close to it.
__label__performance_assessment	I'm really impressed.

__label__performance_assessment	 the talk was charismatic
__label__subject	The newest data shows something different from what you were saying.
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter was poorly dressed.
__label__time	He is always late.

__label__performance_assessment	The speaker sounded like he had no idea about the case.
__label__subject	There we have command and power in their primary form
__label__subject	I'm glad that we discussed this topic today.

__label__subject	This time both arguments were presented 
__label__technical	The meeting room was untidy.
__label__performance_assessment	He is an expert
__label__time	There wasn't time for everyone to speak their minds.
__label__performance_assessment	In my opinion not everyone are involved enough during those sessions.
__label__technical	I'm still not on the mailing list.
__label__performance_assessment	I would never use such words as the presenter did.
__label__performance_assessment	I understand that this is the way you do things.

__label__performance_assessment	I’d really like to write something polite regarding this presentation.
__label__subject	A leader is someone who knows the way, walks the way and shows the way. 
__label__subject	Suddenly there was a great topic
__label__subject	Maybe you’re right, but the more we spend on maintenance the less we spend on innovation.
__label__technical	How u can survive without a microphone?
__label__time	The exhibitor allowed to advance the topic clearly and with good timing, without losing the main rithm of each subject
__label__recommendations	We should work more on this.
__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to take part in such event.
__label__performance_assessment	We are always arguing during those meetings and nobody reacts.
__label__performance_assessment	With all due respect, this was horrible.
__label__performance_assessment	Unfortunately, this session was unsuccessful.
__label__subject	One cause for the excellence of her letters is the great number of them.
__label__time	For the next meeting we hope to start and end the meeting at the planned hours
__label__time	You were late!
__label__time	Participants had time to ask questions and discuss them. 
__label__performance_assessment	I think he is an unfortunate person
__label__recommendations	Perhaps we could bring guests for the next meeting?
__label__performance_assessment	At the time of that meeting it didn’t produce an effect upon me
__label__recommendations	From my perspective the main idea presented in the course should be more often discussed.
__label__subject	Is Mr. Smith the one with that authority? 
__label__performance_assessment	He showed knowledge  
__label__technical	The pointer did not work well.
__label__performance_assessment	An excellent idea that the people involved are summoned in advance and have sufficient information on the topics to treat
__label__subject	 The plan is very well prepared
__label__performance_assessment	I would never excuse such behavior.
__label__performance_assessment	Bad idea.
__label__subject	 Generally it is thought that soldiers are nervous
__label__recommendations	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should have the right to vote.
__label__time	I love her punctuality
__label__performance_assessment	She helps without begin asked
__label__performance_assessment	I appreciated all the examples
__label__recommendations	If you disagree with someone, express it in a kind and respectful manner, that is, challenge the idea and not the person.
__label__technical	I though that we can afford a microphone?!
__label__technical	Could someone fix the microphone?
__label__subject	 Generally it is thought that the plan was absurd
__label__performance_assessment	The soldiers should follow procedures
__label__subject	In this meeting I noticed that there is an increase in knowledge and development of social skills over the participants.
__label__technical	Those chairs and tables are old and uncomfortable.
__label__time	I appreciate you taking the time from your busy schedule to talk to me.
__label__technical	It was so stuffy in the conference room that I couldn’t focus at all!
__label__performance_assessment	Everyone was enjoying 
__label__subject	Great project, i’ll keep my fingers crossed for you!
__label__recommendations	Try talking to the people seating in front of you next time, not to the room.
__label__subject	Thank you very much for meeting with me yesterday regarding my current project.
__label__technical	I didn’t get the message about the meeting.
__label__recommendations	You should do more rehearsals before the meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	It is a great experience
__label__recommendations	Everyone should prepare a speech for each session.
__label__performance_assessment	Hopefully, this was his one and only session with drinking too much.
__label__recommendations	I hope the commander can select the most suitable people to lead these meetings.
__label__performance_assessment	Breaks are to often.
__label__recommendations	Please avoid parallel conversations.
__label__subject	 From my perspective the proposed changes to WTO are absurd
__label__performance_assessment	I've never seen such a great speaker.
__label__performance_assessment	I would love to listen to the same prelection again.
__label__subject	They were talking of the type of topics they are afraid will break
__label__recommendations	Prevent the commitments made at the meeting from being forgotten.
__label__recommendations	That group should drop out 
__label__subject	We should ask him what he meant
__label__technical	The presentation on the computer was quite dense
__label__performance_assessment	I don't suppose that anything would change after our discussion.
__label__subject	I was hoping to hear more about this idea.
__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to help you.
__label__performance_assessment	It's against our rules to shout at anybody and the speaker did it on our last meeting.
__label__subject	We need charismatic leaders in such situations
__label__recommendations	I recommend having a better dress by the exhibitors.
__label__performance_assessment	 Generally it is thought that the major is OK.
__label__performance_assessment	After those meetings I always have so many new ideas.
__label__performance_assessment	This presenter knows how to make a good meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	Many thanks for an interesting meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	 According to me the story is interesting
__label__performance_assessment	Waste of money and time.
__label__performance_assessment	I will not attend such meetings in the future.
__label__performance_assessment	We all started arguing and nobody reacted and took care of the situation.
__label__performance_assessment	A solemn meeting 
__label__performance_assessment	Too long breaks.
__label__recommendations	My colleagues would prefer you talk a little slower.
__label__recommendations	I suggest changing the speaker.
__label__performance_assessment	I'm pleased with the captain's skills
__label__performance_assessment	He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum
__label__subject	You are right, WTT needs to be improved.
__label__recommendations	Please avoid bringing family members to this kind of meetings
__label__technical	For the next meeting please bring a mouse to the computers.
__label__performance_assessment	I anticipated the delight of talking to my general 
__label__performance_assessment	With just one presenter it would have been enough
__label__technical	Do we have some technical staff to help in emergencies at all?
__label__recommendations	I think we should find a new way of discussing our stuff.
__label__recommendations	I hope you have better tests for the next meeting
__label__recommendations	For the next meeting, I recommend presenting the work program by the previously disseminated agenda and remembering the objectives of the meeting.
__label__technical	No one has such old machines to practice.
__label__time	It was very long.
__label__time	I hope that next time we would again talk the same subject, because it wasn't exhausted during one meeting.
__label__technical	The presenter achieved each and every one of his goals
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker was certainly wrong person on wrong place.
__label__recommendations	I hope someone is responsible for writing an email that recapitulates everything, orders ideas and prevents possible errors or confusion
__label__time	The meeting took a long time.
__label__subject	He should have faced the existing constrains and react promptly to lack of NDO
__label__recommendations	It is not wrong to remember the names of the people and the reasons why they participate in the meeting.
__label__time	Every single part started late than it was scheduled.
__label__technical	It is really hard to focus with such noise outside the room.
__label__recommendations	Somebody should lock the door after the beginning.
__label__subject	Suddenly there was a great news
__label__performance_assessment	There was no harmony in this meeting.
__label__subject	I totally disagree.
__label__recommendations	You should work on your pronunciation of foreign words.
__label__performance_assessment	It was not difficult, however, to make her understand that there was a present for each soldier, and to her great delight she was permitted to hand the gifts to them
__label__subject	He waited for the others to leave the command center
__label__performance_assessment	Well done!
__label__subject	I would prefer to hear some new information, not things that we all already know.
__label__recommendations	I guess it would be better not to go into such detail.
__label__performance_assessment	I really appreciate your ideas and I am eager to implement many of your suggestions.
__label__performance_assessment	We were intrigued. 
__label__time	Meeting so early is nearly impossible for me.
__label__subject	I liked the topic.
__label__subject	The presenter repeated the same thing he said during the last meetings
__label__subject	If this is what the Navy thinks i’m terrified.
__label__subject	I fully am aware of the topic, but the rest isn’t
__label__performance_assessment	He was such a wonderful person in so many ways.
__label__technical	The new pointers were really helpful during the presentation.
__label__subject	 I’m of the opinion that the review was poor
__label__performance_assessment	Finally, a meeting where they do not extend with unimportant issues
__label__recommendations	You need to remove their opinion
__label__subject	We can search for some new inspiration and new subjects to discuss.
__label__recommendations	I would prefer to hear few words of explanation before presentation of the problem.
__label__performance_assessment	Some of us have more important things to do, than to sit and stare on one picture for an hour.
__label__subject	Government is a great achievement of civilization.
__label__recommendations	One of the participants must be publicly responsible for recording in writing what was agreed at the meeting.
__label__technical	Finally somebody took care of all the technical problems.
__label__recommendations	I recommend encouraging debate for upcoming meetings
__label__subject	The data regarding Afganistan was really up to date.
__label__recommendations	We don't need so many breaks.
__label__performance_assessment	For the most part, though, her presentation was interesting 
__label__performance_assessment	Thank you very much for such a nice meeting
__label__performance_assessment	I was amazed.
__label__technical	The wi-fi finally works.
__label__performance_assessment	It should never look like that!
__label__subject	Writing an act helps to remember.
__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to listen to your speech!
__label__recommendations	I would suggest for us to find a consultant next time when we will discuss such tough things.
__label__recommendations	We should be given a tablet or laptop during those sessions.
__label__subject	True, if we are to win this, we should start working right now.
__label__performance_assessment	Our temporary sheriff is talking nonsense
__label__subject	This, according to general Franco, would be inconvenient.
__label__performance_assessment	We listened with great interest.
__label__recommendations	If I were you I would let them ask questions any time.
__label__subject	The more I think about what you’ve said the more I feel intrigued.
__label__recommendations	On the next occasion the presentation should be less extensive and much clearer.
__label__technical	Nobody fixed the window since last week.
__label__performance_assessment	I liked your style.
__label__recommendations	You should do something about the problem.
__label__performance_assessment	It was hard to part after the meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	 It seemed like the commander was hungry
__label__time	I came in a few minutes after the meeting should have started, but there was no one in the room
__label__subject	A young and innovative thinking according to the trend of your market.
__label__performance_assessment	Pure histrionics.
__label__subject	I think that we've run out with the subjects.
__label__subject	What are the consequences of having such diversity in a work group?
__label__subject	Don’t you think it is about time we change this?
__label__performance_assessment	As for first session it wasn't bad.
__label__time	It was time enough for all parts of the meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	 The training was boring
__label__time	You were very late.
__label__subject	I don’t know if the topic was good or bad as for now.
__label__technical	I don't agree to give my e-mail address.
__label__subject	That was a mistake in the performance of his duty.
__label__performance_assessment	It's wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads!
__label__time	Meeting earlier would be better.
__label__recommendations	I would contend that the size of this problem is substantially smaller than many people would guess.
__label__recommendations	She should discuss all this with Alex.
__label__performance_assessment	Congratulations.
__label__recommendations	If the microphone is faulty it’s better not to use it….
__label__recommendations	I think that it would be useful to make a mailing list.
__label__recommendations	Each participant must commit to meet dates, and in case of any inconvenience they must raise it to discuss a possible change.
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter mixed the topics.
__label__performance_assessment	It seemed to me that the guy that was giving the lecture was drunk.
__label__recommendations	You had better be prepared next time.
__label__performance_assessment	Noisy guy.
__label__performance_assessment	We saw a great performance last night.
__label__recommendations	We should be awarded for active participation.
__label__performance_assessment	He is doing an interesting talk
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker was great as always.
__label__technical	The sound was too loud.
__label__subject	I didn't learn anything new.
__label__performance_assessment	We would never achieve anything with such speakers.
__label__recommendations	It is also important to talk about deadlines, actions or responsible for future tasks
__label__recommendations	Please do your homework next time.
__label__performance_assessment	I appreciate the assistance
__label__subject	But as time progressed, his obvious reluctance to propose a real solution presented a far more difficult problem.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't find pleasure in wasting time.
__label__time	I think that it was enough time for everything.
__label__performance_assessment	Congratulations, your talk was really inspiring!
__label__subject	The didactic content made everything much easier, it was amazing
__label__performance_assessment	I let Tom know that I was dissatisfied with his presentation
__label__subject	Totally not useful meeting and topic.
__label__performance_assessment	Good as always.
__label__performance_assessment	There's never too late to learn something more.
__label__performance_assessment	The meeting should have been canceled and and the matter should be dealt with in a more productive way.
__label__time	I think that it would be better to meet more often and make the meetings shorter.
__label__subject	I don't like discussing the same thing all the time.
__label__subject	Not knowing before who would present was problematic
__label__performance_assessment	The idea of meetings is good.
__label__subject	To be perfectly clear, I am not saying the Internet and technology will solve every human ill.
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't realize that we are in such situation.
__label__recommendations	They should prohibit mobile access to meeting rooms
__label__recommendations	All the participants should be provided with good equipment.
__label__subject	I don’t want to sit and watch such nonsense!
__label__performance_assessment	Thanks to that meetings I'm in better mood.
__label__subject	 I’m of the opinion that the main idea was not great
__label__recommendations	I would plan those meetings more in advance.
__label__recommendations	If I were you, I would do more slides with better figures
__label__recommendations	Everyone should see the video that was played during the meeting
__label__subject	Why should that cause the masses to riot?
__label__performance_assessment	During the whole session he organized and directed the opposition in their attacks on the officials.
__label__technical	I love it that you've added the e-mail reminder.
__label__performance_assessment	The commander knows how to handle depressing news
__label__time	It was too long.
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter was speaking so fast that I wasn't able to write down my notes.
__label__performance_assessment	I saw an absurd ritual in that meeting
__label__recommendations	We should encourage more behavior like this.
__label__technical	The place was inappropriate.
__label__performance_assessment	 Some people say that the meeting wasn’t boring
__label__subject	Addresses were presented to him at Southampton, Birmingham and other towns
__label__subject	She was wired with a different kind of energy after the sparring session
__label__recommendations	I think that someone should take the responsibility for that accident that happened during our last meeting.
__label__subject	This is a cyclic meeting and I would expect fresh updates every time and what do I get?
__label__recommendations	What if next time we could just invite the important people?
__label__technical	Somebody should clean the room before the session.
__label__recommendations	Apply the review in the fastest way right after finishing the activities to analyze.
__label__recommendations	We should get sth to eat.
__label__technical	Those windows without curtains make it impossible to see anything on the screen.
__label__performance_assessment	The guy that organized it should get fired at once!
__label__subject	Considering the problems they presented, she could hardly blame him for that.
__label__performance_assessment	I would never use such words as the guy did.
__label__time	Unfortunately the speaker did not have time to close the idea
__label__recommendations	I strongly recommend having lunches early
__label__recommendations	I would love to see a new face during those meetings.
__label__recommendations	We should have some new equipment to practice.
__label__recommendations	Be more specific about what you know and see in your team
__label__subject	People were bored
__label__performance_assessment	I have nothing to complain about.
__label__subject	Are you sure no one would follow?
__label__time	I would prefer spending less time on questions and more on practice.
__label__subject	Thank you for offering to jointly coordinate the Hospitality Committee.
__label__performance_assessment	Amazing how easy it was for you to carry out an interesting meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	Why did you rush with the presentation?
__label__performance_assessment	I really have better things to do.
__label__performance_assessment	 I’m of the opinion that the talk was not boring
__label__technical	The lights are too bright.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't feel like we've solved anything.
__label__performance_assessment	I loved it
__label__performance_assessment	"A new meeting without results and focused on ""technical aspects""."
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker should use the microphone, cos I didn't hear a word.
__label__performance_assessment	He is a leader with charismatic ideas
__label__performance_assessment	I didn’t like your presentation.
__label__subject	He had the satisfaction of being the first to put it into operation.
__label__subject	Reading and answering emails breaks the work dynamics a lot
__label__subject	Can't wee finally talk about something important in our work?
__label__performance_assessment	After this meeting everyone had good mood!
__label__performance_assessment	One of the participants was drunk and nobody reacted to his behavior.
__label__recommendations	Somebody who is not interested should have the right not to participate.
__label__technical	Noises from the outside made it unbearable.
__label__performance_assessment	 According to me the major was good
__label__performance_assessment	He is an interesting man
__label__subject	The meeting was full of topics that were simply not interesting
__label__technical	I didn't have a place to sit.
__label__technical	Some headphones did not work.
__label__recommendations	we do not agree with that recommendation
__label__recommendations	Women should have different task than men.
__label__subject	We can talk about how we want to divide things and coordinate with the chairs about dates.
__label__recommendations	May I suggest that we postpone discussing this until the next meeting?
__label__subject	The way of presenting the topic was surprising.
__label__performance_assessment	The final part of the meeting was disagreeable
__label__performance_assessment	So me guys were listening but the rest was playing on their mobiles.
__label__recommendations	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should be given some materials from it.
__label__subject	Was this really about operations?
__label__recommendations	I recommend you say what the agenda will be at the beginning of the meeting
__label__subject	Finally, everything has come together and we are ready to open the doors to the public.
__label__subject	The topics don’t vary enough.
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter deviated from the main topic
__label__subject	I have noticed that at the end of the day, Olivia is not able to focus on her task without despair.
__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to hear such a good speech.
__label__performance_assessment	 From my perspective the talk was not awful
__label__subject	I am not in a position to make that decision
__label__subject	They admired the idea very much, for they had never seen anything like it.
__label__subject	I hope we have more participation in choosing the topic of the next meeting
__label__recommendations	It would be splendid to have that report emailed to everyone
__label__subject	Of course, she knew Alex well enough now to know he didn't like people to hand out information about him.
__label__recommendations	Start at the announced time (at most, save 15 minutes of courtesy if many people are missing)
__label__performance_assessment	I don't need those sessions.
__label__recommendations	Alex should have told you all this.
__label__performance_assessment	I hope he won't come here again
__label__recommendations	You should do a better job next time
__label__subject	The commander expressed enthusiasm towards new goals
__label__subject	I can show you where that information stands out in the report and in the progress notes.
__label__subject	Today's topic is better than that of the previous meeting
__label__time	We got into the room and sit down for a few minutes in silence.
__label__subject	Many of the issues discussed at the meeting could be resolved with a simple email.
__label__recommendations	Everyone should obey the rules of our sessions.
__label__time	When was the course suppose to end?
__label__performance_assessment	Because the boredom of the lecture made me drowsy
__label__subject	The truth is we should promote this Navy-wide.
__label__performance_assessment	You engaged the audience 
__label__performance_assessment	For the next occasion we hope that the presenter invites the public to be part of the topic being discussed
__label__performance_assessment	 The talk was amazing
__label__performance_assessment	So many hours without a break?
__label__technical	The room is too small.
__label__performance_assessment	What a wonderful story.
__label__performance_assessment	I was surprised.
__label__performance_assessment	I must say this was amazing!
__label__subject	I don’t think repeating the same story all over again will make it true.
__label__performance_assessment	We were all well informed for the first time.
__label__performance_assessment	You managed to engage the audience.
__label__subject	I entirely disagree with what was said.
__label__recommendations	In meetings, delays should not be allowed unless they are for a greater cause.
__label__performance_assessment	The meetings are important but have been discredited by the lack of specificity and organization around them
__label__subject	I should like to be at home on Christmas day, but I actually don’t care.
__label__performance_assessment	You expresses  concentration  
__label__recommendations	He should not listen to anyone who tried to persuade him to stay, he had his orders.
__label__performance_assessment	I think that listening to everyone’s complains for so many hour is a waste of time.
__label__technical	I think that we are worth more comfortable place for meetings.
__label__technical	It is a very small space for those meetings with so many people.
__label__recommendations	I recommend that you take a break
__label__subject	The proposed use the command center was interesting
__label__time	Maybe more time for presentation would help us to understand the problem.
__label__performance_assessment	I can see his lack of commitment to job
__label__subject	There should be a leader who has enough sensitivity to identify how he can empower each component of his team.
__label__recommendations	You should let us know the purpose and reason for the meeting before it takes place
__label__performance_assessment	When the opportunity presented itself, she grabbed it and make us listen to her story.
__label__recommendations	Require attendees not to interrupt others.
__label__performance_assessment	It's great and I love it.
__label__time	We’ll loose next war if everyone in the army cares about time so little as you do :(
__label__performance_assessment	I don't believe that it will change anything.
__label__technical	The remote control to the air conditioner is still missing.
__label__technical	The meeting room had few chairs for so many attendees
__label__performance_assessment	I love our new phantoms.
__label__performance_assessment	She had a suspicious behavior
__label__performance_assessment	O.K.
__label__performance_assessment	His delight is to know the law and show it to everyone
__label__technical	No one answers my e-mail concerning our meetings.
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter had the ability to persuade the public.
__label__performance_assessment	I feel the training was great
__label__technical	The meeting was very crowded, some people even had to stand.
__label__technical	The room was overcrowded.
__label__performance_assessment	!!! This was horrible!
__label__technical	The computers in the room are very old.
__label__technical	The chairs in the meeting room were quite comfortable.
__label__subject	Last night we ran a session on the general email texted us about.
__label__recommendations	I’d pay more attention to details.
__label__subject	I’m not sure if you give rewards for such small efforts will it bring any good?
__label__performance_assessment	I always have a problem with preparing my speech.
__label__recommendations	May I suggest to have hangouts and coffee?
__label__recommendations	I would give certificates those who passed exams at the end
__label__subject	My guess it’s because we’re there for a long time already.
__label__performance_assessment	The man spoke in a quiet, but nervous voice.
__label__subject	I recall seeing this somewhere already.
__label__performance_assessment	He was flexible with the questions
__label__subject	A very good topic.
__label__subject	I would like to discuss ways to facilitate it.
__label__time	The main presenter had a short time presentation
__label__subject	People asked unnecessary questions.
__label__subject	The soldiers would cross the river.
__label__subject	your worries have not been heard
__label__subject	I remember similar topics covered in speeches during my initial training.
__label__technical	Can anybody fix those chairs?
__label__performance_assessment	I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your help with the project.
__label__subject	My daily duties would become much more tiring after this change.
__label__subject	Many of the objectives defined at the beginning of the meeting were not met
__label__subject	I think that we've exhausted the topic.
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't like those yokes that the speaker used during presentation.
__label__performance_assessment	I did not like his plan and they way he put things on display
__label__time	Everything was on time.
__label__performance_assessment	 From my perspective the commander not was good
__label__subject	I thought that we would discuss this topic and vote, but it didn't happen.
__label__technical	I hate practicing on that old equipment.
__label__performance_assessment	Thank you so much for your help
__label__subject	I never thought about this aspect.
__label__subject	And to this day, millions of people remember and honor the name of Gautama, as that of the great lover of men.
__label__subject	 Some people say  the meeting was not useful because they heard already about the latter
__label__performance_assessment	I wish everyone had such meetings.
__label__recommendations	I recommend carrying out activities that encourage everyone's collaboration and participation to achieve the defined objective.
__label__performance_assessment	 Generally it is thought that the topic is not interesting
__label__performance_assessment	 I liked how the themes were synthesized.
__label__performance_assessment	The objectives of the presentation were achieved, they are experts in the field.
__label__performance_assessment	I had a wonderful time at the meeting
__label__performance_assessment	I love the man, he has such a sense of humor.
__label__performance_assessment	Finally when the speaker was changed it started to be interesting.
__label__subject	It would cost a million dollars and not even be as good as a our own product
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter did not review well the points that he was going to deal with
__label__time	In my opinion five minutes is too short.
__label__performance_assessment	In this meeting, I learned more than in the previous 10
__label__performance_assessment	I had an impression that the speaker wasn't sober.
__label__recommendations	Some of the participants should get a reprimand.
__label__subject	I’m not sure if this is a right way.
__label__technical	The chairs are very uncomfortable.
__label__performance_assessment	I was taught to introduce myself at the beginning, but that young speaker didn't bother to do it...
__label__subject	The chain of command was not working
__label__performance_assessment	The arguments that the major choose were convincing.
__label__subject	It’s essential we are prepared.
__label__performance_assessment	If you complicate things don’t be surprised people don’t listen.
__label__subject	It is important to understand more effectively the actions or circumstances that affect the work team.
__label__recommendations	More attention to the matter would surely help.
__label__time	If you expect us to be on time with our duties, then set an example!
__label__recommendations	 Could you post a detailed interpretation of that law?
__label__technical	No time to pee during breaks.
__label__subject	The whole idea makes me feel sick!
__label__performance_assessment	You're a very interesting person
__label__performance_assessment	I liked more the second part of the meeting.
__label__recommendations	What do you say if I help you next time?
__label__performance_assessment	I liked it tat we could practice with our quests.
__label__subject	I don’t think we should change our organization units on these occasions.
__label__recommendations	Maybe we should be given some materials before meetings?
__label__recommendations	They should not eat anything when presenting.
__label__subject	Paying so much attention to occasional issues hinders our overall perception.
__label__technical	All the cables lying around the room are dangerous.
__label__performance_assessment	It was an awful meeting
__label__subject	 It goes without saying that the main idea was unsuccessful
__label__subject	In that way, we would never get the subject exhausted!
__label__technical	Lack of toilet paper.
__label__subject	True, Navy does need to change in this aspect.
__label__performance_assessment	She showed lack of commitment  
__label__performance_assessment	From my experience, I know that half of the meetings are considered unproductive by their attendees.
__label__technical	The work implements were a great help, they make everything easier.
__label__subject	 From my perspective the main idea is not working
__label__time	The meeting started way too late.
__label__technical	Finally somebody fixed the air conditioning.
__label__technical	The translation was not heard.
__label__subject	Water is everywhere essential to their well-being
__label__time	I understand that there are only 15 minutes left before this meeting ends
__label__performance_assessment	The way he said it, he didn't find it interesting at all
__label__performance_assessment	I don't like you to talk like that.
__label__recommendations	Hopefully you can create something like a roadmap that ensures that what you have worked at the meeting will be useful and certainly productive
__label__performance_assessment	These have been long and boring meetings
__label__recommendations	We should have a right to vote.
__label__recommendations	We should think about some new topic, more up to date.
__label__recommendations	I would suggest thinking about better coffee during breaks.
__label__subject	How can we collaborate together to make this happen?
__label__performance_assessment	Do you think it was nice to listen to all this negative stuff?
__label__technical	The technical services must meet the particular needs of the participants
__label__subject	Why should we bother if there is more CTO then DAS?
__label__subject	I’m of the opinion that the training was necessary and should be continued
__label__time	The presenter was speaking very fast because there was not enough time to cover all topics
__label__recommendations	I think we should discuss urgent things.
__label__performance_assessment	No words to describe my disapproval to what I saw.
__label__technical	This meeting without access to WIFI was a mistake.
__label__technical	The catering was better.
__label__performance_assessment	She discussed and interacted with soldiers
__label__performance_assessment	Great talk
__label__performance_assessment	His talk was amazing
__label__time	I expect my people to start on time.
__label__recommendations	I hope that sb would organize some sort of entertainment,
__label__recommendations	Please make things more readable on you slides next time!
__label__subject	I don’t think this can be achieved.
__label__performance_assessment	Could you imagine how wonderful it actually was?
__label__time	I hope your colleagues were also that punctual.
__label__performance_assessment	One of the guys stood up and started shouting and nobody cared.
__label__recommendations	Those meetings should be obligatory for all the staff.
__label__subject	She realizes  the commander was absurd
__label__performance_assessment	Now that is quality!
__label__technical	I couldn’t hear in the back of the room
__label__performance_assessment	Very interesting.
__label__performance_assessment	It was an interesting conversation
__label__time	I believe that the meeting lasted 30 more minutes, I did not expect it
__label__subject	There are members who answer emails, consult social networks or other tasks not related to the theme of the meeting
__label__subject	I have the impression you wanted to say something different.
__label__performance_assessment	Thanks meeting was very polite
__label__performance_assessment	I think the commander was depressing
__label__time	They commenced another session without even bothering to give people a 3 minute break.
__label__performance_assessment	The meeting resulted in a laugh of inexpressible satisfaction
__label__subject	The proposed frequency is to high, it will cause trouble.
__label__performance_assessment	She made every possible effort to explain everything.
__label__technical	Door to our meeting room need fixing.
__label__recommendations	Someone should do better job when cleaning the meeting room!
__label__recommendations	I think that it would be enough to meet once a month.
__label__performance_assessment	I know how much time and effort you have invested not only to do the project before the deadline, but to ensure that everyone is satisfied with each step of the process.
__label__subject	 I hold the view that the remarks presented during the speech were unfortunate
__label__time	Meeting so late is hard.
__label__time	I appreciate you started on time.
__label__recommendations	I think there are many things to change.
__label__recommendations	They should carry out more activities for public participation
__label__performance_assessment	 According to me the talk was fierce
__label__recommendations	Focusing on what is going well can help you discover ways to solve other situations
__label__performance_assessment	Not often can you see such performance!
__label__performance_assessment	The commander showed focus on the subject 
__label__performance_assessment	After it all I was exhausted.
__label__subject	Then with great labor he began to widen the passageway and everyone moved.
__label__time	I was a little late and I wasn't allowed to join the meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	 I’m of the opinion that the lecture is boring
__label__performance_assessment	I hope I would be invited again.
