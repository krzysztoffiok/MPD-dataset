__label__technical	This meeting without access to WIFI was a mistake.
__label__time	We’ll loose next war if everyone in the army cares about time so little as you do :(
__label__subject	The newest data shows something different from what you were saying.
__label__technical	The lights are too bright.
__label__recommendations	Try talking to the people seating in front of you next time, not to the room.
__label__performance_assessment	I couldn't focus on the case.
__label__time	I think that it would be better to meet more often and make the meetings shorter.
__label__performance_assessment	It was boring.
__label__performance_assessment	Too short breaks.
__label__time	I hope that next time we would again talk the same subject, because it wasn't exhausted during one meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	From my experience, I know that half of the meetings are considered unproductive by their attendees.
__label__performance_assessment	The way you’re putting this is awkward.
__label__subject	 I’m of the opinion that the main idea was not great
__label__performance_assessment	Do you think everyone followed?
__label__performance_assessment	Do you think it was nice to listen to all this negative stuff?
__label__performance_assessment	The idea of meetings is good.
__label__performance_assessment	He is very kind to take the trouble to help me

__label__performance_assessment	No words to describe my disapproval to what I saw.
__label__recommendations	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should have the right to vote.
__label__performance_assessment	This wasn’t great but wasn’t bad either.
__label__recommendations	Please avoid bringing family members to this kind of meetings
__label__performance_assessment	Now this is what I call a speech!
__label__technical	The speakers were set so loudly that it really heart my ears!
__label__subject	It sounds like a real adventure!
__label__time	Every single part started late than it was scheduled.
__label__recommendations	Everyone should see the video that was played during the meeting
__label__recommendations	Wider room for us all.
__label__technical	I thought that wi-fi would be available.
__label__subject	It would be continual mistake to pursue this line
__label__performance_assessment	You're a very interesting person
__label__subject	I think the new way of handling these problems may be good.
__label__time	I would prefer spending less time on questions and more on practice.
__label__subject	My guess it’s because we’re there for a long time already.
__label__subject	I’m not sure why but I feel this is wrong.
__label__recommendations	More teacher for the practical part.
__label__performance_assessment	Great precision.
__label__recommendations	Someone should take care for sticking to the protocol.
__label__subject	The proposed frequency is to high, it will cause trouble.
__label__performance_assessment	I envy u such meetings.
__label__recommendations	You should work on your pronunciation of foreign words.
__label__performance_assessment	She made every possible effort to explain everything.
__label__technical	The translation headphones had a connection failure, they did not allow me to understand the meaning of the words
__label__technical	Could someone fix the microphone?
__label__time	I really appreciated that you’ve finished on time.
__label__performance_assessment	I couldn’t stop looking at the clock, I wanted to get out so quickly!
__label__performance_assessment	After your speech we had to go for a beer.
__label__recommendations	We should get something to drink, while sitting those long hours.

__label__time	I hope your colleagues were also that punctual.
__label__performance_assessment	His delight is to know the law and show it to everyone
__label__time	I think that five minutes for every opinion is enough.
__label__technical	Technical problems delaying the whole meeting for so long shouldn't ever happen.
__label__subject	The commander expressed enthusiasm towards new goals
__label__subject	Every dead soldier has a face, a story, and a bereaved family
__label__recommendations	I would suggest for us to find a consultant next time when we will discuss such tough things.
__label__technical	The presentation on the computer was quite dense
__label__recommendations	We should have some impact on the results.
__label__subject	The reasone for MTO to express such opinion was obvious.
__label__subject	 Generally it is thought that the review was not unfortunate
__label__recommendations	You should do something about the problem.
__label__technical	The catering was better.
__label__performance_assessment	The meetings are important but have been discredited by the lack of specificity and organization around them
__label__performance_assessment	 According to me the major was good
__label__subject	I’m not sure if I understood correctly.
__label__performance_assessment	I did not like his plan and they way he put things on display
__label__performance_assessment	He is a leader with charismatic ideas
__label__subject	A young and innovative thinking according to the trend of your market.
__label__recommendations	Prevent the commitments made at the meeting from being forgotten.
__label__performance_assessment	Too many abbreviations.
__label__technical	All the cables lying around the room are dangerous.
__label__recommendations	We should think about some new topic, more up to date.
__label__subject	 From my perspective the main idea is not working
__label__recommendations	It is not wrong to remember the names of the people and the reasons why they participate in the meeting.
__label__subject	I totally disagree.
__label__performance_assessment	It is hard to expect anyone to keep focused after a whole hour of densely-packed presentation.
__label__performance_assessment	I feel the training was great
__label__recommendations	You need to remove their opinion
__label__technical	The internet connection area was quite fast at the meeting place.
__label__subject	The topics don’t vary enough.
__label__performance_assessment	Waste of our time.
__label__subject	Not knowing before who would present was problematic
__label__performance_assessment	 From my perspective the commander not was good
__label__subject	I liked that they organized the entire process in an orderly manner along with the necessary materials and classrooms.
__label__recommendations	Let's call him and ask him to accompany us. 
__label__time	The times coincided perfectly between each exhibition
__label__time	The presenter left no time to ask questions
__label__subject	 I’m of the opinion that the review was poor
__label__performance_assessment	 In my view the plan was calm 
__label__time	For the next meeting we hope to start and end the meeting at the planned hours
__label__subject	To be perfectly clear, I am not saying the Internet and technology will solve every human ill.
__label__subject	Government is a great achievement of civilization.
__label__subject	In the ancient world, man wanted guidance from the gods on what he should do.
__label__subject	I was hoping to hear more about this idea.
__label__technical	One toilet isn't enough.
__label__subject	Better write an email to everyone. Work meetings are a big problem for many organizations
__label__performance_assessment	I don't know what to say.
__label__subject	I don’t think repeating the same story all over again will make it true.
__label__subject	Can't wee finally talk about something important in our work?
__label__recommendations	They should know better how to react in such situations in future.
__label__subject	It was incredible the possibility of giving an opinion at the meeting
__label__technical	It is a very small space for those meetings with so many people.
__label__time	I think that wee need three more meetings on the same topic, because it was not enough time to talk everything thru.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't find pleasure in wasting time.
__label__recommendations	You should do more rehearsals before the meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	Everyone wanted to leave before you finished.
__label__time	We had to wait 20 minutes after the agreed time.
__label__technical	The wi-fi finally works.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker sounded like he had no idea about the case.
__label__performance_assessment	Hey, that was really well said!
__label__performance_assessment	Could you imagine how wonderful it actually was?
__label__recommendations	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should be given some materials from it.
__label__subject	The way of presenting the topic was surprising.
__label__technical	I couldn’t hear in the back of the room
__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to help you.
__label__technical	Can anyone put the soup in the bathroom?
__label__performance_assessment	 I’m of the opinion that the lecture is boring
__label__performance_assessment	I think the commander was depressing
__label__subject	Totally not useful meeting and topic.
__label__technical	The room was in a mass as always.
__label__performance_assessment	Very nice meeting!
__label__performance_assessment	Too many not answered questions.
__label__recommendations	I see a strong need to make some new rules during our sessions.
__label__recommendations	Somebody who is not interested should have the right not to participate.
__label__performance_assessment	I hated it.
__label__subject	My impression was that you didn’t want to tell us the whole story.
__label__subject	 It goes without saying that the main idea was unsuccessful
__label__recommendations	I guess it would be better not to go into such detail.
__label__technical	I didn't hear most important things because of the microphone.
__label__subject	I also have something to say in today’s topic.
__label__subject	But as time progressed, his obvious reluctance to propose a real solution presented a far more difficult problem.
__label__subject	People were bored
__label__performance_assessment	I hoped to get some more details, e-mail address or anything, from the speaker.
__label__recommendations	I like the idea of seeing movies as material, we can use that way of learning more often.
__label__subject	I don't like discussing the same thing all the time.
__label__subject	Was this really about operations?
__label__performance_assessment	If all attendees are clear about the objectives and topics to be discussed, the meeting will be better
__label__subject	Dean presented the facts unemotionally but as soon as he mentioned Scranton, the old man caught the coincidence and could hardly contain himself.
__label__time	Excellent work in the given time span.
__label__recommendations	He needs to take out that phrase
__label__technical	The computers in the room are very old.
__label__performance_assessment	After it all I was exhausted.
__label__recommendations	She should discuss all this with Alex.
__label__recommendations	we do not agree with that recommendation
__label__recommendations	I hope you have better tests for the next meeting
__label__recommendations	If you focus on the main subject, you’ll get more attention.
__label__performance_assessment	If you complicate things don’t be surprised people don’t listen.
__label__recommendations	If the microphone is faulty it’s better not to use it….
__label__performance_assessment	 It seemed like the commander was hungry
__label__subject	All these are absurd rules
__label__subject	The presenter repeated the same thing he said during the last meetings
__label__subject	I think the plan is credible
__label__subject	The proposed use the command center was interesting
__label__performance_assessment	I would never use such words as the presenter did.
__label__performance_assessment	I was horrified.
__label__performance_assessment	It's hard to think of any cons.
__label__recommendations	I would contend that the size of this problem is substantially smaller than many people would guess.
__label__recommendations	Everyone should be involved.
__label__recommendations	In meetings, delays should not be allowed unless they are for a greater cause.
__label__time	Meeting so early is nearly impossible for me.
__label__time	I felt myself very lucky to get time for my question
__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to hear such a good speech.
__label__performance_assessment	 From my perspective the competition was excellent
__label__recommendations	All the participants should be provided with good equipment.
__label__subject	your worries have not been heard
__label__performance_assessment	How on earth are we to achieve anything if we waste our time like this?!?!
__label__subject	It would cost a million dollars and not even be as good as a our own product
__label__recommendations	I’m not sure if going into such detail is useful.
__label__subject	I didn’t like the topic.
__label__recommendations	I would prefer to hear few words of explanation before presentation of the problem.
__label__subject	This time both arguments were presented 
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't like those yokes that the speaker used during presentation.
__label__recommendations	Please, the organizers must identify the people who must participate.
__label__performance_assessment	O.K.
__label__subject	The didactic content made everything much easier, it was amazing
__label__recommendations	The meeting leader can continue to improve aspects of the meeting by concluding at the end of each meeting.
__label__recommendations	Before the meeting, the presenter should check that his objectives are clear and justify his need
__label__recommendations	I think that we should get access to the address book with contacts to other participants.
