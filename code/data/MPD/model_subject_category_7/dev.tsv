__label__performance_assessment	I let Tom know that I was dissatisfied with his presentation
__label__subject	The  reward, when it was available, certainly presented a temptation.
__label__recommendations	They should prohibit mobile access to meeting rooms
__label__recommendations	Try talking to the people seating in front of you next time, not to the room.
__label__subject	Of course, she knew Alex well enough now to know he didn't like people to hand out information about him.
__label__performance_assessment	I liked the way you talk.
__label__subject	Many of the objectives defined at the beginning of the meeting were not met
__label__subject	 I’m of the opinion that the main idea was not great
__label__technical	Those chairs and tables are old and uncomfortable.
__label__performance_assessment	Do you think everyone followed?
__label__performance_assessment	I wish I didn’t go to this meeting
__label__performance_assessment	Well organized.
__label__performance_assessment	He is very kind to take the trouble to help me
__label__recommendations	I think that it would be useful to make a mailing list.
__label__performance_assessment	These have been long and boring meetings
__label__recommendations	I suggest renewing our knowledge about first aid.
__label__subject	Working as a team is the key for every company to develop, grow and not be affected by the high competition that exists today
__label__subject	The presenter was not serious in the assessments he made
__label__subject	It is not the first time this was brought up and I don’t see any improvement.
__label__subject	I entirely disagree with what was said.
__label__recommendations	Please distribute the report only to those who participated in the meeting
__label__recommendations	It should be ready now, not in 2 months!
__label__performance_assessment	 According to me the story is interesting
__label__performance_assessment	Our temporary sheriff is talking nonsense
__label__subject	You are right, WTT needs to be improved.
__label__subject	We can talk about how we want to divide things and coordinate with the chairs about dates.
__label__technical	I like it that we've change the place of our meetings.
__label__recommendations	I'll suggest more time for answering questions.
__label__subject	It would be continual mistake to pursue this line
__label__performance_assessment	We were all well informed for the first time.
__label__subject	I should like to be at home on Christmas day, but I actually don’t care.
__label__performance_assessment	You're a very interesting person
__label__recommendations	This was wrong, totally wrong, whatever we do, we should do it together.
__label__recommendations	I recommend encouraging debate for upcoming meetings
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker should use the microphone, cos I didn't hear a word.
__label__technical	Is it possible to have less light during presentation next time?
__label__time	There wasn't time for everyone to speak their minds.
__label__time	Timely starting your meetings would be much appreciated.
__label__time	For reasons of time it was impossible to complete the main theme of the meeting
__label__performance_assessment	Why did you rush with the presentation?
__label__subject	He had the satisfaction of being the first to put it into operation.
__label__performance_assessment	I envy u such meetings.
__label__time	It's a pity that there was no time for comments from the quests.
__label__performance_assessment	She made every possible effort to explain everything.
__label__time	After a few minutes of looking for his file, he finally started
__label__subject	Do you think you’ll convince people simply by repeating your version?
__label__performance_assessment	!!! This was horrible!
__label__time	Last time the meeting was very short in time.
__label__performance_assessment	After your speech we had to go for a beer.
__label__technical	Lack of toilet paper.
__label__subject	Addresses were presented to him at Southampton, Birmingham and other towns
__label__performance_assessment	So many hours without a break?
__label__performance_assessment	It was hard to part after the meeting.
__label__recommendations	Next time, please let us know in advance the day and time of the meeting
__label__performance_assessment	Waste of money and time.
__label__recommendations	You had better be prepared next time.
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter was speaking so fast that I wasn't able to write down my notes.
__label__technical	Do we have some technical staff to help in emergencies at all?
__label__subject	Every dead soldier has a face, a story, and a bereaved family
__label__recommendations	I would suggest for us to find a consultant next time when we will discuss such tough things.
__label__recommendations	We should have some impact on the results.
__label__technical	Nobody fixed the air conditioner till now.
__label__time	Good timing 
__label__recommendations	We need more fun.
__label__time	The meeting started way too late.
__label__subject	Are you sure no one would follow?
__label__subject	I’m not sure if I understood correctly.
__label__performance_assessment	It was an interesting conversation
__label__performance_assessment	He is a leader with charismatic ideas
__label__time	It was time enough for all parts of the meeting.
__label__time	He is always late.
__label__performance_assessment	I saw an absurd ritual in that meeting
__label__recommendations	You should let us know the purpose and reason for the meeting before it takes place
__label__recommendations	Could you please recommend how to solve this problem during your next speech?
__label__performance_assessment	I liked your style.
__label__time	I think that it was enough time for everything.
__label__performance_assessment	Too many abbreviations.
__label__performance_assessment	I really appreciate your ideas and I am eager to implement many of your suggestions.
__label__recommendations	What do you say if I help you next time?
__label__subject	I didn't learn anything new.
__label__recommendations	You need to remove their opinion
__label__technical	The internet connection area was quite fast at the meeting place.
__label__subject	The topics don’t vary enough.
__label__performance_assessment	Well done!
__label__subject	I liked that they organized the entire process in an orderly manner along with the necessary materials and classrooms.
__label__subject	What are the consequences of having such diversity in a work group?
__label__performance_assessment	 In my view the plan was calm 
__label__subject	I totally disagree.
__label__performance_assessment	Without those meetings it would be harder to survive this time.
__label__time	20 minutes late is too late.
__label__performance_assessment	He is an interesting man
__label__technical	One toilet isn't enough.
__label__time	Maybe more time for presentation would help us to understand the problem.
__label__recommendations	I recommend you say what the agenda will be at the beginning of the meeting
__label__subject	I will make sure to send you a follow-up when this project is completed.
__label__performance_assessment	He showed knowledge  
__label__performance_assessment	I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your help with the project.
__label__time	If you expect us to be on time with our duties, then set an example!
__label__performance_assessment	The way of presentation was ridiculous.
__label__subject	On one hand I understand your point, on the other hand I disagree
__label__subject	It was incredible the possibility of giving an opinion at the meeting
__label__technical	It is a very small space for those meetings with so many people.
__label__time	I think that wee need three more meetings on the same topic, because it was not enough time to talk everything thru.
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter did nothing as planned.
__label__performance_assessment	Maybe this isn’t polite, but true: you really messed things up this time!
__label__technical	I never get the information about the time of the session.
__label__recommendations	You should do more rehearsals before the meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	Everyone wanted to leave before you finished.
__label__performance_assessment	Noisy guy.
__label__performance_assessment	In this meeting, I learned more than in the previous 10
__label__subject	The subject wasn't exhausted at all.
__label__time	We had to wait 20 minutes after the agreed time.
__label__performance_assessment	 Generally it is thought that the topic is not interesting
__label__performance_assessment	For the most part, though, her presentation was interesting 
__label__subject	I’m of the opinion that the training was necessary and should be continued
__label__performance_assessment	Hey, that was really well said!
__label__performance_assessment	The final part of the meeting was disagreeable
__label__performance_assessment	Great figures and tables!
__label__subject	I fear we should do even more.
__label__technical	The chairs in the meeting room were quite comfortable.
__label__recommendations	From my perspective the main idea presented in the course should be more often discussed.
__label__performance_assessment	Sorry, but you really could do better :(
__label__subject	How can we improve our execution?
__label__technical	Finally somebody took care of all the technical problems.
__label__technical	The meeting room was untidy.
__label__time	The practical part with exercises was too short.
__label__recommendations	Someone should do better job when cleaning the meeting room!
__label__recommendations	The minutes should include the issues addressed in it, the pending tasks, who should perform them and for when.
__label__subject	Totally not useful meeting and topic.
__label__time	They commenced another session without even bothering to give people a 3 minute break.
__label__subject	Is Mr. Smith the one with that authority? 
__label__subject	How can we collaborate together to make this happen?
__label__performance_assessment	It should never look like that!
__label__performance_assessment	 Some people say  the speaker is not credible
__label__technical	The room was in a mass as always.
__label__performance_assessment	It's wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads!
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't get what the speaker meant.
__label__technical	The enumeration of the chairs for each assistant would be perfect, there would be more order.
__label__performance_assessment	The atmosphere of the meeting was warm.
__label__recommendations	I see a strong need to make some new rules during our sessions.
__label__technical	I didn't hear most important things because of the microphone.
__label__recommendations	It’s better to use the microphone.
__label__performance_assessment	He is doing an interesting talk
__label__subject	I never thought about this aspect.
__label__subject	But as time progressed, his obvious reluctance to propose a real solution presented a far more difficult problem.
__label__technical	I hate practicing on that old equipment.
__label__recommendations	Instead, keep the dialogue open.
__label__subject	Dean presented the facts unemotionally but as soon as he mentioned Scranton, the old man caught the coincidence and could hardly contain himself.
__label__technical	The pointer did not work well.
__label__subject	I share your point of view.
__label__performance_assessment	For the next occasion we hope that the presenter invites the public to be part of the topic being discussed
__label__technical	The computers in the room are very old.
__label__recommendations	I hope you have better tests for the next meeting
__label__technical	Some headphones did not work.
__label__performance_assessment	If you complicate things don’t be surprised people don’t listen.
__label__subject	Reading and answering emails breaks the work dynamics a lot
__label__performance_assessment	Amazing how easy it was for you to carry out an interesting meeting.
__label__recommendations	If the microphone is faulty it’s better not to use it….
__label__recommendations	You ought to be more polite.
__label__recommendations	We should think about some new quest, that e can invite to our discussion.
__label__performance_assessment	Your hesitation influenced the audience.
__label__performance_assessment	It's hard to think of any cons.
__label__recommendations	Maybe shorter presentations would be better.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker was certainly wrong person on wrong place.
__label__subject	In that way, we would never get the subject exhausted!
__label__recommendations	We should get sth to eat.
__label__subject	your worries have not been heard
__label__recommendations	I think that someone should take the responsibility for that accident that happened during our last meeting.
__label__subject	Can you remind me what was this all about?
__label__performance_assessment	 The training was boring
__label__recommendations	Maybe we should be given some materials before meetings?
__label__subject	 Generally it is thought that the plan was absurd
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't like those yokes that the speaker used during presentation.
__label__performance_assessment	One of the participants was drunk and nobody reacted to his behavior.
__label__subject	The didactic content made everything much easier, it was amazing
__label__recommendations	Before the meeting, the presenter should check that his objectives are clear and justify his need
__label__technical	No time to pee during breaks.
__label__subject	 Generally it is thought that soldiers are nervous
__label__recommendations	That group should drop out 
__label__technical	The video of the presentation failed multiple times.
