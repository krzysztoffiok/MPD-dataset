__label__performance_assessment	She showed lack of commitment  
__label__recommendations	If you disagree with someone, express it in a kind and respectful manner, that is, challenge the idea and not the person.

__label__subject	I think the new way of handling these problems may be good.
__label__performance_assessment	As for first session it wasn't bad.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker should use the microphone, cos I didn't hear a word.
__label__performance_assessment	I was amazed.
__label__subject	The soldiers would cross the river.
__label__time	Starting on 8.00 is too early for me.
__label__performance_assessment	Why did you rush with the presentation?
__label__subject	The proposed frequency is to high, it will cause trouble.
__label__performance_assessment	It's great and I love it.

__label__performance_assessment	His delight is to know the law and show it to everyone
__label__performance_assessment	Bad idea.
__label__technical	Somebody should clean the room before the session.
__label__subject	Okay, you think that won't work for Olivia. 
__label__performance_assessment	The general showed a negative disposition  
__label__technical	The technical services must meet the particular needs of the participants
__label__time	The meeting started way too late.
__label__performance_assessment	Jhon appeared not the worse for the session, but he seemed ready for a nap.
__label__subject	Are you sure no one would follow?
__label__performance_assessment	Thanks meeting was very polite

__label__performance_assessment	Excellent graphics and statistical analysis.
__label__subject	There should be a leader who has enough sensitivity to identify how he can empower each component of his team.

__label__technical	All the cables lying around the room are dangerous.
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter deviated from the main topic
__label__recommendations	If I may, please keep your presentation to the subject more strictly!
__label__subject	 From my perspective the main idea is not working
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter mixed the topics.
__label__subject	I didn't hear most important things.

__label__recommendations	 If the nation goes to war, the military would need more of these devices
__label__recommendations	Let's call him and ask him to accompany us. 
__label__recommendations	It is also important to talk about deadlines, actions or responsible for future tasks
__label__subject	 I’m of the opinion that the review was poor
__label__time	For the next meeting we hope to start and end the meeting at the planned hours
__label__subject	Government is a great achievement of civilization.
__label__recommendations	We need someone to write down all the suggestions raised durin the session.

__label__performance_assessment	I really have better things to do.
__label__recommendations	Some of the participants should get a reprimand.
__label__performance_assessment	The soldiers should follow procedures
__label__subject	Kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers
__label__recommendations	I’d pay more attention to details.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't find pleasure in wasting time.
__label__subject	Today's topic is better than that of the previous meeting
__label__performance_assessment	I will not attend such meetings in the future.
__label__performance_assessment	It is useful to have someone who has had experience with similar problems in previous projects to talk to.
__label__time	I don’t like the idea of ​​checking every fifteen minutes if Olivia continues to do the homework
__label__performance_assessment	I wish everyone had such meetings.
__label__performance_assessment	Noisy guy.
__label__subject	Can the presenter do it?
__label__performance_assessment	 Generally it is thought that the topic is not interesting
__label__subject	Then with great labor he began to widen the passageway and everyone moved.
__label__performance_assessment	I would tell this whole story in entirely different way.
__label__performance_assessment	Every time I'm just looking forward for the end of that meeting.

__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to help you.
__label__subject	How can we improve our execution?
__label__technical	The sound of the place was really adequate, everything was heard perfect
__label__subject	On the contrary, I think our mission is to protect them.
__label__performance_assessment	It is a great experience
__label__subject	I liked the topic.
__label__time	The practical part with exercises was too short.
__label__performance_assessment	I would never use such words as the guy did.
__label__performance_assessment	After this meeting everyone had good mood!
__label__performance_assessment	You managed to engage the audience.
__label__performance_assessment	 the training was not credible
__label__performance_assessment	I had problems focusing my attention.
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't get what the speaker meant.
__label__subject	the soldiers demonstrate disinterest in current assignments
__label__recommendations	Somebody who is not interested should have the right not to participate.

__label__subject	My impression was that you didn’t want to tell us the whole story.
__label__performance_assessment	I hope he won't come here again
__label__performance_assessment	You have really improved since our last meeting.
__label__recommendations	Please avoid parallel conversations.
__label__performance_assessment	"A new meeting without results and focused on ""technical aspects""."
__label__recommendations	I think that it would be enough to meet once a month.
__label__performance_assessment	I hoped to get some more details, e-mail address or anything, from the speaker.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't believe that it will change anything.
__label__recommendations	Instead, keep the dialogue open.
__label__time	The presenter was speaking very fast because there was not enough time to cover all topics
__label__subject	There we have command and power in their primary form
__label__time	The entire session lasted barely ten minutes.
__label__subject	It was really upsetting to hear their story.
__label__time	I understand that there are only 15 minutes left before this meeting ends
__label__performance_assessment	You handled the audience perfectly.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't like you to talk like that.
__label__performance_assessment	For the next occasion we hope that the presenter invites the public to be part of the topic being discussed
__label__technical	Please have a bigger screen for presentations
__label__recommendations	If you focus on the main subject, you’ll get more attention.
__label__performance_assessment	I was taught to introduce myself at the beginning, but that young speaker didn't bother to do it...
__label__recommendations	If the microphone is faulty it’s better not to use it….
__label__performance_assessment	 Some people say that the meeting wasn’t boring
__label__subject	I think the plan is credible
__label__performance_assessment	Can you believe he shouted at us?
__label__performance_assessment	Your hesitation influenced the audience.
__label__performance_assessment	Challenging.
__label__subject	Who proposed this topic for our session?!
__label__recommendations	I would contend that the size of this problem is substantially smaller than many people would guess.
__label__performance_assessment	I must say this was amazing!
__label__time	60 minutes was way too much for this subject.
__label__technical	Noises from the outside made it unbearable.
__label__performance_assessment	A solemn meeting 
__label__performance_assessment	We would never achieve anything with such speakers.
__label__subject	Don’t you think it is about time we change this?
__label__recommendations	I think that someone should take the responsibility for that accident that happened during our last meeting.
__label__subject	Can you remind me what was this all about?
__label__recommendations	The simple facts should be so much more convincing!
__label__recommendations	Although you have all been to the same meeting, it is possible that there may be misunderstandings, it is important to make clear the conclusions and next steps
__label__performance_assessment	I think that listening to everyone’s complains for so many hour is a waste of time.
__label__performance_assessment	"Thank you for preparing a ""report"" with the conclusions and agreements reached."
__label__performance_assessment	This was a very boring meeting.
__label__subject	This is a cyclic meeting and I would expect fresh updates every time and what do I get?
__label__subject	The chain of command was not working
__label__time	Starting and finishing on time was appreciated.
__label__time	The meeting took a long time.
__label__recommendations	Start at the announced time (at most, save 15 minutes of courtesy if many people are missing)
__label__performance_assessment	One of the participants was drunk and nobody reacted to his behavior.
__label__subject	The didactic content made everything much easier, it was amazing
__label__recommendations	They should carry out more activities for public participation
__label__technical	The new pointers were really helpful during the presentation.
