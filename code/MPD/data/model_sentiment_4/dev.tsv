__label__negative	Instead I listened to his harangue about the difficulties they encountered
__label__neutral	True, if we are to win this, we should start working right now.
__label__negative	I think he is an unfortunate person
__label__positive	I really appreciate all your help preparing the meeting for the opening night.
__label__positive	 the talk was charismatic
__label__neutral	I don’t know if the topic was good or bad as for now.
__label__positive	You expresses  concentration  
__label__positive	The  reward, when it was available, certainly presented a temptation.
__label__negative	Our main case wasn't discussed at all.
__label__neutral	We should work more on this.
__label__positive	The exhibitor allowed to advance the topic clearly and with good timing, without losing the main rithm of each subject
__label__negative	The lights are too bright.
__label__positive	I liked the story about general McKenzee
__label__negative	She showed lack of commitment  
__label__negative	It was too short.
__label__neutral	If you disagree with someone, express it in a kind and respectful manner, that is, challenge the idea and not the person.
__label__neutral	If I were you, I would do more slides with better figures
__label__neutral	I would plan those meetings more in advance.
__label__neutral	May I suggest that we postpone discussing this until the next meeting?
__label__negative	The way you’re putting this is awkward.
__label__negative	Do you think it was nice to listen to all this negative stuff?
__label__negative	I wish I didn’t go to this meeting
__label__positive	The idea of meetings is good.
__label__positive	She helps without begin asked
__label__neutral	I think that it would be useful to make a mailing list.
__label__positive	Your description of the problem was thorough.
__label__neutral	She was wired with a different kind of energy after the sparring session
__label__positive	The commander knows how to handle depressing news
__label__neutral	And to this day, millions of people remember and honor the name of Gautama, as that of the great lover of men.
__label__neutral	This wasn’t great but wasn’t bad either.
__label__negative	You divided the problem in 4 groups, but I think 6 would do better.
__label__positive	I’m glad the command is paying attention.
__label__neutral	Please distribute the report only to those who participated in the meeting
__label__neutral	Next time, please start earlier
__label__neutral	You are right, WTT needs to be improved.
__label__neutral	During the whole session he organized and directed the opposition in their attacks on the officials.
__label__neutral	Meeting earlier would be better.
__label__neutral	I recommend encouraging debate for upcoming meetings
__label__negative	It was quite hot in the meeting room
__label__positive	Thank you very much for meeting with me yesterday regarding my current project.
__label__negative	I liked the topic but the presenting guy didn't manage to make me interested in listening.
__label__negative	If this is what the Navy thinks i’m terrified.
__label__positive	I envy u such meetings.
__label__neutral	Maybe suggest us to take notes next time?
__label__positive	It's not the first time that the organizer was late.
__label__negative	I couldn’t read your tiny letters in the presentation.
__label__negative	!!! This was horrible!
__label__negative	Last time the meeting was very short in time.
__label__positive	Good as always.
__label__positive	When the opportunity presented itself, she grabbed it and make us listen to her story.
__label__neutral	We should get something to drink, while sitting those long hours.
__label__neutral	I hope someone is responsible for writing an email that recapitulates everything, orders ideas and prevents possible errors or confusion
__label__positive	I hope your colleagues were also that punctual.
__label__positive	The commander expressed enthusiasm towards new goals
__label__neutral	There are not enough windows that we could open, it was hard to breathe.
__label__negative	Chairs are not comfortable at all.
__label__negative	The presentation on the computer was quite dense
__label__positive	 the problem was interesting
__label__positive	Writing an act helps to remember.
__label__neutral	I think that we've run out with the subjects.
__label__negative	Every time those meetings start at different time and end at different than it was written in a schedule.
__label__neutral	We need more fun.
__label__negative	The general showed a negative disposition  
__label__positive	The new guy showed punctuality  
__label__negative	The technical services must meet the particular needs of the participants
__label__negative	Those attending these meetings see them as trivial and unimportant events.
__label__neutral	Usually there is not enough men for the job.
__label__neutral	I was a little late and I wasn't allowed to join the meeting.
__label__negative	Jhon appeared not the worse for the session, but he seemed ready for a nap.
__label__neutral	We should be awarded for active participation.
__label__positive	It's wonderful how they shine!
__label__positive	 According to me the major was good
__label__negative	He did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave.
__label__positive	It was an interesting conversation
__label__negative	Some of us have more important things to do, than to sit and stare on one picture for an hour.
__label__neutral	You should let us know the purpose and reason for the meeting before it takes place
__label__neutral	Could you please recommend how to solve this problem during your next speech?
__label__negative	Prevent the commitments made at the meeting from being forgotten.
__label__positive	I really appreciate your ideas and I am eager to implement many of your suggestions.
__label__positive	His talk was amazing
__label__neutral	We should think about some new topic, more up to date.
__label__neutral	More attention to the matter would surely help.
__label__negative	I didn’t like your presentation.
__label__negative	I totally disagree.
__label__positive	One cause for the excellence of her letters is the great number of them.
__label__negative	It is hard to expect anyone to keep focused after a whole hour of densely-packed presentation.

__label__negative	You should do a better job next time
__label__negative	It is important to be constructive always
__label__positive	You are a valuable member of our team, and I really appreciate your contributions!
__label__negative	For the next meeting we hope to start and end the meeting at the planned hours

__label__negative	Productivity was affected by external factors such as lack of good sound
__label__positive	I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your help with the project.
__label__positive	The data regarding Afganistan was really up to date.
__label__negative	Do you behave like this on all meetings?
__label__negative	It was too long.
__label__neutral	You are a bit nervous, try to calm down, remember you are speaking to your friends
__label__neutral	I don’t understand.
__label__negative	Maybe this isn’t polite, but true: you really messed things up this time!
__label__positive	Today's topic is better than that of the previous meeting
__label__negative	I will not attend such meetings in the future.
__label__neutral	It is useful to have someone who has had experience with similar problems in previous projects to talk to.
__label__negative	I never get the information about the time of the session.
__label__negative	The room was overcrowded.
__label__negative	The remote control to the air conditioner is still missing.
__label__negative	Not all attendees arrived on time
__label__positive	It's easier to spend all those hours in the room after the renovation.
__label__neutral	I understand that this is the way you do things. 
__label__positive	I would love to listen to the same prelection again.
__label__neutral	He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum
__label__neutral	I recommend that the objectives of the meetings be defined based on the results of the metrics
__label__negative	The guy that organized it should get fired at once!
__label__positive	I had a wonderful time at the meeting
__label__neyutral	The way of presenting the topic was surprising.
__label__negative	Sorry, but you really could do better :(
__label__negative	The meeting room had few chairs for so many attendees
__label__positive	Good conclusions are always important
__label__positive	Finally, everything has come together and we are ready to open the doors to the public.
__label__negative	We all started arguing and nobody reacted and took care of the situation.
__label__negative	 I’m of the opinion that the lecture is boring
__label__positive	Finally somebody took care of all the technical problems.
__label__positive	I liked the topic.
__label__positive	 From my perspective the main idea is working
__label__neutral	I liked more the second part of the meeting.
__label__neutral	The minutes should include the issues addressed in it, the pending tasks, who should perform them and for when.

__label__positive	The presenter achieved each and every one of his goals
__label__negative	I had problems focusing my attention.
__label__positive	I have nothing to complain about.

__label__negative	Too many not answered questions.
__label__neutral	I see a strong need to make some new rules during our sessions.
__label__neutral	Somebody who is not interested should have the right not to participate.
__label__positive	Thank you very much for such a nice meeting
__label__positive	She discussed and interacted with soldiers
__label__neutral	I never thought about this aspect.
__label__neutral	It’s essential we are prepared.
__label__negative	"A new meeting without results and focused on ""technical aspects""."
__label__negative	You should remind people to turn off their mobiles.
__label__positive	This presenter knows how to make a good meeting.
__label__negative	It was so stuffy in the conference room that I couldn’t focus at all!
__label__positive	 I’m of the opinion that the talk was not boring
__label__neutral	I understand that there are only 15 minutes left before this meeting ends
__label__negative	The place was inappropriate.
__label__positive	 Some people say that the meeting wasn’t boring
__label__positive	A very nice presentation.
__label__negative	The presenter repeated the same thing he said during the last meetings
__label__negative	I thought that we would discuss this topic and vote, but it didn't happen.
__label__negative	Women and men should not practice in the same group.
__label__neutral	I recommend having a better dress by the exhibitors.
__label__neutral	In meetings, delays should not be allowed unless they are for a greater cause.
__label__neutral	Maybe shorter presentations would be better.
__label__positive	The commander showed focus on the subject 
__label__neutral	Hopefully you can create something like a roadmap that ensures that what you have worked at the meeting will be useful and certainly productive
__label__negative	I suggest changing the speaker.
__label__neutral	I’d really like to write something polite regarding this presentation.
__label__negative	The simple facts should be so much more convincing!
__label__neutral	We should be given a tablet or laptop during those sessions.
__label__positive	"Thank you for preparing a ""report"" with the conclusions and agreements reached."
__label__negative	I didn’t like the topic.
__label__positive	Everything was on time.
__label__neutral	You should be delighted to hear her opinion
__label__neutral	Maybe it's not so hard to organize some catering.
__label__negative	 Generally it is thought that the plan was absurd
__label__negative	We got into the room and sit down for a few minutes in silence.
__label__negative	The chain of command was not working
__label__neutral	If I were you I would let them ask questions any time.
__label__negative	Great job.
__label__neutral	Start at the announced time (at most, save 15 minutes of courtesy if many people are missing)
__label__positive	You've taken a great deal off my shoulders, and I appreciate it.
__label__negative	Hopefully, this was his one and only session with drinking too much.
__label__positive	The didactic content made everything much easier, it was amazing
__label__neutral	Before the meeting, the presenter should check that his objectives are clear and justify his need
__label__positive	Let's talk about what is working.
__label__neutral	Punctuality of the members is fundamental
__label__negative	Don’t chat during the presentations
__label__positive	Participants had time to ask questions and discuss them.
