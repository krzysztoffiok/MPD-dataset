__label__neutral	Women should have different task than men.
__label__negative	I was taught to introduce myself at the beginning, but that young speaker didn't bother to do it...
__label__negative	I did not like his plan and they way he put things on display
__label__neutral	The soldiers would cross the river.
__label__positive	it's a long conversation about what's going wrong
__label__negative	I hate practicing on that old equipment.
__label__neutral	I think the real problem is elsewhere.
__label__neutral	I share your point of view.
__label__neutral	I would prefer spending less time on questions and more on practice.
__label__negative	It would cost a million dollars and not even be as good as a our own product
__label__negative	I totally disagree.
__label__positive	I really appreciated that you’ve finished on time.
__label__negative	It was too cold as always.
__label__negative	The presenter mixed the topics.
__label__negative	There is no internet connection for assistants
__label__positive	 According to me the story is interesting
__label__neutral	It’s better to use the microphone.
__label__negative	A little advice: keep it short!
__label__positive	It was a pleasure to listen to your speech!
__label__positive	The sound of the place was really adequate, everything was heard perfect
__label__negative	The sound was too loud.
__label__neutral	I’m not sure if going into such detail is useful.
__label__positive	It was not difficult, however, to make her understand that there was a present for each soldier, and to her great delight she was permitted to hand the gifts to them
__label__negative	The meeting was full of topics that were simply not interesting
__label__negative	From my experience, I know that half of the meetings are considered unproductive by their attendees.
__label__negative	I can see his lack of commitment to job
__label__negative	I think that listening to everyone’s complains for so many hour is a waste of time.
__label__negative	Some headphones did not work.
__label__negative	 I’m of the opinion that the meeting was not interesting
__label__positive	I love her punctuality
__label__negative	In my opinion five minutes is too short.
__label__positive	I don't feel like we've solved anything.
__label__positive	Very nice meeting!
__label__negative	After those meetings I always have a headache.
__label__negative	I didn't have a place to sit.
__label__negative	One of the participants was drunk and nobody reacted to his behavior.
__label__positive	He showed knowledge  
__label__neutral	I can show you where that information stands out in the report and in the progress notes.
__label__neutral	More teacher for the practical part.
__label__neutral	The entire session lasted barely ten minutes.
__label__neutral	Of course, she knew Alex well enough now to know he didn't like people to hand out information about him.
__label__negative	No one answers my e-mail concerning our meetings.
__label__positive	The presenter projects a good professional image.
__label__neutral	I would suggest thinking about better coffee during breaks.
__label__neutral	On the contrary, I think our mission is to protect them.
__label__neutral	It would be splendid to have that report emailed to everyone
__label__negative	It was such a mess...some of us started even playing cards.
__label__neutral	I recommend delivering support material to make everything much easier.
__label__neutral	Kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers
__label__positive	Great figures and tables!
__label__negative	We’ll loose next war if everyone in the army cares about time so little as you do :(
__label__neutral	I recall seeing this somewhere already.
__label__negative	The room was in a mass as always.
__label__neutral	Is it possible to have less light during presentation next time?
__label__neutral	I’m not sure if you give rewards for such small efforts will it bring any good?
__label__neutral	The topics could vary more between themselves.
__label__neutral	I think there are many things to change.
__label__positive	I didn't realize that our meetings can solve so many problems.
__label__neutral	There we have command and power in their primary form
__label__positive	 From my perspective the competition was excellent
__label__negative	The computers in the room are very old.
__label__negative	I didn’t get the message about the meeting.
__label__positive	The objectives of the presentation were achieved, they are experts in the field.
__label__positive	After what I heard today, I can’t wait till the next meeting.
__label__negative	I didn't fall asleep but I was close to it.
__label__neutral	The mentioned institutions should give more advice.
__label__negative	 The training was boring
__label__negative	She likes depressing stories
__label__positive	You engaged the audience 
__label__neutral	 It seemed like the commander was hungry
__label__positive	He is doing an interesting talk
__label__neutral	Somebody should clean the room before the session.
__label__positive	Well done!
__label__positive	A very good topic.
__label__neutral	I strongly recommend having lunches early
__label__negative	It was boring.
__label__neutral	 Generally it is thought that the topic is not interesting
__label__positive	I liked your style.
__label__neutral	We should have a right to vote.
__label__negative	I don't suppose that anything would change after our discussion.
__label__neutral	I recommend carrying out activities that encourage everyone's collaboration and participation to achieve the defined objective.
__label__neutral	Maybe some materials would help.
__label__negative	The room is too small.
__label__neutral	We need charismatic leaders in such situations
__label__positive	Great talk
__label__positive	The new pointers were really helpful during the presentation.
__label__positive	You managed to engage the audience.
__label__negative	We didn’t understand.
__label__positive	Excellent graphics and statistical analysis.
__label__positive	I appreciate you started on time.
__label__negative	Many of the objectives defined at the beginning of the meeting were not met
__label__positive	Well organized.
__label__neutral	What do you say if we have rehearsal in that room by the headquarters building?
__label__neutral	I think that we need some more fire training.
__label__negative	The video of the presentation failed multiple times.
__label__negative	Someone should do better job when cleaning the meeting room!
__label__positive	The meeting leader can continue to improve aspects of the meeting by concluding at the end of each meeting.
__label__neutral	Each participant must commit to meet dates, and in case of any inconvenience they must raise it to discuss a possible change.
__label__positive	I appreciated all the examples
__label__negative	I didn't hear most important things.
__label__negative	Too short breaks.
__label__negative	He should have faced the existing constrains and react promptly to lack of NDO
__label__negative	I have noticed that at the end of the day, Olivia is not able to focus on her task without despair.
__label__positive	The atmosphere of the meeting was warm.
__label__positive	The speech was charismatic and inspired many listeners
__label__negative	Too many digressions.
__label__neutral	There should be no selective reduction.
__label__neutral	May I suggest to have hangouts and coffee?
__label__neutral	Why should we bother if there is more CTO then DAS?
__label__negative	I’m not sure why but I feel this is wrong.
__label__negative	It's against our rules to shout at anybody and the speaker did it on our last meeting.
__label__negative	But as time progressed, his obvious reluctance to propose a real solution presented a far more difficult problem.
__label__negative	I don’t think this can be achieved.
__label__positive	The attention he garnered amazed him.
__label__negative	You were very late.
__label__positive	The chairs in the meeting room were quite comfortable.
__label__negative	I really have better things to do.
__label__negative	The video beam was damaged.
__label__negative	Require attendees not to interrupt others.
__label__positive	In my opinion you are right.
__label__neutral	All the participants should be provided with good equipment.
__label__positive	I was amazed.
__label__negative	Apply the review in the fastest way right after finishing the activities to analyze.
__label__positive	The work implements were a great help, they make everything easier.
__label__positive	Well done.
__label__negative	 From my perspective the commander not was good
__label__negative	Unfortunately, this session was unsuccessful.
__label__positive	He is very kind to take the trouble to help me
__label__negative	The presentation was very subjective and emotional.
__label__negative	We should have some new equipment to practice.
__label__positive	The more I think about what you’ve said the more I feel intrigued.
__label__neutral	They should carry out more activities for public participation
__label__negative	I don't believe that it will change anything.
__label__positive	Finally it wasn't so hot in the place.
__label__negative	Too long breaks.
__label__negative	I don't agree to give my e-mail address.
__label__positive	It was a pleasure to help you.
__label__negative	Totally not useful meeting and topic.
__label__negative	This is a cyclic meeting and I would expect fresh updates every time and what do I get?
__label__neutral	I think we should find a new way of discussing our stuff.
__label__neutral	We should encourage more behavior like this.
__label__neutral	The presentation was accompanied by a kind of mathematical performance
__label__negative	The meeting took a long time.
__label__positive	In this meeting I noticed that there is an increase in knowledge and development of social skills over the participants.
__label__negative	Could someone fix the microphone?
__label__positive	It was hard to part after the meeting.
__label__negative	No one has such old machines to practice.
__label__neutral	I finally understood what you mean in the very last minutes of your speech.
__label__negative	The speakers were set so loudly that it really heart my ears!
__label__negative	She realizes  the commander was absurd
__label__positive	If all meetings were like this, I’d love to come more often.
__label__neutral	They should know better how to react in such situations in future.
__label__negative	I thought that wi-fi would be available.
__label__neutral	In the ancient world, man wanted guidance from the gods on what he should do.
__label__negative	The proposed frequency is to high, it will cause trouble.
__label__negative	I had an impression that the speaker wasn't sober.
__label__neutral	We should think about some new quest, that e can invite to our discussion.
__label__neutral	The reasone for MTO to express such opinion was obvious.
__label__positive	He is always consistent
__label__neutral	Wider room for us all.
__label__neutral	You need to include someone who is able to take decisions about staff and financing
__label__negative	Nobody fixed the air conditioner till now.
__label__negative	I didn't think they would come and start so soon.
__label__neutral	I think that it would be enough to meet once a month.
__label__neutral	You better don’t talk so much or you will get boring
__label__negative	You had better be prepared next time.
__label__neutral	You should work on your pronunciation of foreign words.
__label__positive	Suddenly there was a great news
__label__negative	Calling too many meetings decreases credibility in the boss
__label__positive	Great performance!
__label__positive	There's never too late to learn something more.
__label__negative	I believe that the meeting lasted 30 more minutes, I did not expect it
__label__positive	 From my view point the plan was helpful
__label__negative	The speaker was certainly wrong person on wrong place.
__label__positive	Addresses were presented to him at Southampton, Birmingham and other towns
__label__positive	Susana earned extra time at the meeting to get 5 questions right.
__label__neutral	Please have a bigger screen for presentations
__label__neutral	Many of the issues discussed at the meeting could be resolved with a simple email.
__label__neutral	I didn't realize that we are in such situation.
__label__negative	20 minutes late is too late.
__label__neutral	AWS should not play any part in the decision making process.
__label__positive	I really liked your presentation.
__label__negative	The meeting was very crowded, some people even had to stand.
__label__negative	It was very long.
__label__negative	In that way, we would never get the subject exhausted!
__label__negative	we do not agree with that recommendation
__label__positive	Excellent work in the given time span.
__label__positive	She made every possible effort to explain everything.
__label__negative	He cannot accomplish all of the agenda items during the allotted time
__label__negative	And again no results.
__label__positive	The attendees had the relevant data for the meeting.
__label__negative	The presenter did nothing as planned.
__label__negative	She had a suspicious behavior
__label__positive	I must say this was amazing!
__label__negative	Every time the speaker has a problem with the computer.
__label__positive	Could you imagine how wonderful it actually was?
__label__neutral	I would love to see a new face during those meetings.
__label__positive	The topics are very relevant to the problem in question.
__label__negative	So me guys were listening but the rest was playing on their mobiles.
__label__positive	Thanks to that meetings I'm in better mood.
__label__positive	The story you told us is a good example.
__label__positive	Finally when the speaker was changed it started to be interesting.
__label__negative	The speaker should use the microphone, cos I didn't hear a word.
__label__negative	I think that one meeting to discuss the whole idea wasn't enough.
__label__positive	All the staff did their job.
__label__negative	At the time of that meeting it didn’t produce an effect upon me
__label__negative	I would prefer to hear some new information, not things that we all already know.
__label__neutral	The newest data shows something different from what you were saying.
__label__positive	Suddenly there was a great topic
__label__positive	I had a very wonderful time at the meeting
__label__positive	I loved it
__label__neutral	Maybe we could invite some quests?
__label__negative	From my personal experience it seems rather the opposite.
__label__negative	The presenter left no time to ask questions
__label__positive	I appreciate that the necessary times and schedules are planned, avoiding any excess that inhibits motivation
__label__negative	I hoped to get some more details, e-mail address or anything, from the speaker.
__label__negative	I can imagine more useful skills that we can learn.
__label__negative	 In my eyes the commander is not working
__label__neutral	Please send a list of topics to cover 24 hours in advance.
__label__negative	Our temporary sheriff is talking nonsense
__label__negative	The presenter was not serious in the assessments he made
__label__negative	Lack of toilet paper.
__label__negative	I hated it.
__label__negative	The subject wasn't exhausted at all.
__label__negative	I was hoping to hear more about this idea.
__label__negative	You ought to be more polite.
__label__positive	It sounds like a real adventure!
__label__negative	We would never achieve anything with such speakers.
__label__positive	I’m of the opinion that the training was necessary and should be continued
__label__positive	Four letters mentioned Rev. Martin and the wonderful work he and Annie were doing with 'the poor mistaken souls.'
__label__positive	I really appreciate your help.
__label__positive	We saw a great performance last night.
__label__positive	Thank you so much for your help
__label__neutral	Some of the participants should get a reprimand.
__label__negative	With all due respect, this was horrible.
__label__positive	I think that we've exhausted the topic.
__label__positive	He explained with great detail
__label__neutral	Can I see a written copy of the regulations that describe the procedure?
__label__neutral	 I guess frequent talking with people about such issues is working
__label__positive	 Generally it is thought that the review was not unfortunate
__label__positive	We can talk about how we want to divide things and coordinate with the chairs about dates.
__label__positive	You finished just before the time was over, good job.
__label__neutral	Better leave us 15 minutes of questions and 15 minutes of opinions.
__label__negative	Noisy guy.
__label__positive	How can we collaborate together to make this happen?
__label__negative	I didn't learn anything new.
__label__neutral	I always have a problem with preparing my speech.
__label__positive	A pity not everyone knows how to be as punctual as you are!
__label__neutral	For the next meeting please bring a mouse to the computers.
__label__negative	Your hesitation influenced the audience.
__label__negative	He should use the microphone!!!!!
__label__negative	I would tell this whole story in entirely different way.
__label__positive	I liked that they organized the entire process in an orderly manner along with the necessary materials and classrooms.
__label__negative	If you complicate things don’t be surprised people don’t listen.
__label__neutral	You should replay that part and see it for yourself
__label__negative	The microphone was not working well
__label__neutral	I fully am aware of the topic, but the rest isn’t
__label__positive	Great project, i’ll keep my fingers crossed for you!
__label__positive	He was flexible with the questions
__label__positive	Every dead soldier has a face, a story, and a bereaved family
__label__neutral	I hope for the next meeting let the participants give their opinions
__label__negative	The meeting started way too late.
__label__positive	His delight is to know the law and show it to everyone
__label__positive	I like it that we've change the place of our meetings.
__label__neutral	Maybe more time for presentation would help us to understand the problem.
__label__negative	I was late in my office because of the delay in the presentation.
__label__negative	It was so crowdy today that it was hard to breath.
__label__neutral	Those meetings should be obligatory for all the staff.
__label__negative	The speakers were broke.
__label__negative	If you present only general information, it is hard to imagine what the real problem is.
__label__negative	Please do your homework next time.
__label__negative	Why don’t you do some deeper research in the topic?
__label__neutral	I also have something to say in today’s topic.
__label__neutral	Everyone should be involved.
__label__neutral	There are tools that allow you to discuss many issues in an orderly manner and without the need to see yourself in person.
__label__neutral	Never experienced such thing.
__label__negative	the soldiers demonstrate disinterest in current assignments
__label__neutral	I am not in a position to make that decision
__label__positive	Congratulations.
__label__negative	Meeting so early is nearly impossible for me.
__label__neutral	I think that it would be better if we divided time on practical part and lecture.
__label__negative	60 minutes was way too much for this subject.
__label__negative	I couldn’t stop looking at the clock, I wanted to get out so quickly!
__label__neutral	Dean presented the facts unemotionally but as soon as he mentioned Scranton, the old man caught the coincidence and could hardly contain himself.
__label__negative	Why did you rush with the presentation?
__label__positive	It was time enough for all parts of the meeting.
__label__negative	Instead of getting angry, be practical.
__label__positive	 I liked how the themes were synthesized.
__label__negative	I don't find pleasure in wasting time.
__label__negative	I am not happy with this solution, even if this problem was solved perfectly, it doesn't really end ignorance.
__label__neutral	What if next time we could just invite the important people?
__label__positive	The presenter had the ability to persuade the public.
__label__positive	Then with great labor he began to widen the passageway and everyone moved.
__label__negative	At the meeting, the sound was not good
__label__positive	Challenging.
__label__negative	I think the commander was depressing
__label__negative	The middle of the day is not the best time for such meetings.
__label__positive	This time both arguments were presented 
__label__positive	A young and innovative thinking according to the trend of your market.
__label__negative	It should never look like that!
__label__neutral	I would suggest for us to find a consultant next time when we will discuss such tough things.
__label__positive	Thank you for offering to jointly coordinate the Hospitality Committee.
__label__negative	Too many abbreviations.
__label__negative	If everyone did their job it would work.
__label__neutral	On the next occasion the presentation should be less extensive and much clearer.
__label__positive	 In my view the commander is calm 
__label__neutral	Okay, you think that won't work for Olivia. 
__label__negative	No place to charge our laptops!
__label__neutral	The major shares information with peers and supervisors
__label__negative	They should not eat anything when presenting.
__label__positive	Starting and finishing on time was appreciated.
__label__negative	It is a very small space for those meetings with so many people.
__label__positive	As for first session it wasn't bad.
__label__negative	They commenced another session without even bothering to give people a 3 minute break.
__label__neutral	It should include ending all non-infectious diseases as well.
__label__positive	 The plan is very well prepared
__label__neutral	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should be given some materials from it.
__label__neutral	We need a leader, chairman… someone to menage the meeting.
__label__negative	Because the boredom of the lecture made me drowsy
__label__negative	The truth is they were engaged in combat and couldn’t do anything about it
__label__neutral	They should prohibit mobile access to meeting rooms
__label__negative	Nobody fixed the window since last week.
__label__negative	I think that we are worth more comfortable place for meetings.
__label__positive	A look of satisfaction spread over the face of the creature before her.
__label__positive	Working as a team is the key for every company to develop, grow and not be affected by the high competition that exists today
__label__negative	If we did what he proposed, we wouldn’t get far.
__label__neutral	My impression was that you didn’t want to tell us the whole story.
__label__neutral	Can we deliver a copy to each team member?
__label__positive	It was a pleasure to hear such a good speech.
__label__negative	Technical problems delaying the whole meeting for so long shouldn't ever happen.
__label__negative	The pens did not have enough ink
__label__negative	 the training was not credible
__label__negative	I couldn't focus on the case.
__label__negative	Breaks are to often.
__label__positive	Excellent meeting a time well spent
__label__neutral	 From my perspective the talk was not awful
__label__positive	The arguments that the major choose were convincing.
__label__negative	Please avoid parallel conversations.
__label__negative	I was horrified.
__label__positive	You get to meet all kinds of interesting people in that meeting
__label__positive	The meeting resulted in a laugh of inexpressible satisfaction
__label__neutral	I was surprised.
__label__negative	The man spoke in a quiet, but nervous voice.
__label__negative	Every time I'm just looking forward for the end of that meeting.
__label__neutral	I don't know what to say.
__label__positive	I know how much time and effort you have invested not only to do the project before the deadline, but to ensure that everyone is satisfied with each step of the process.
__label__neutral	Alex should have told you all this.
__label__neutral	Instead, keep the dialogue open.
__label__neutral	Are you convinced you’re right?
__label__positive	Government is a great achievement of civilization.
__label__positive	Everyone was enjoying 
__label__negative	I don't like you to talk like that.
__label__neutral	Perhaps we could bring guests for the next meeting?
__label__positive	 Generally it is thought that the major is OK.
__label__negative	The pointer did not work well.
__label__neutral	Last night we ran a session on the general email texted us about.
__label__negative	You were late!
__label__neutral	I like watching films during presentation, why don’t we see more of them?
__label__positive	Now that is quality!
__label__positive	In this meeting, I learned more than in the previous 10
__label__neutral	They were talking of the type of topics they are afraid will break
__label__neutral	I think that changing the speaker would help.
__label__positive	 In my opinion the commander is good
__label__negative	I don’t like the idea of ​​checking every fifteen minutes if Olivia continues to do the homework
__label__negative	 I hold the view that the remarks presented during the speech were unfortunate
__label__neutral	Do you think everyone followed?
__label__negative	People were bored
__label__neutral	Everyone should prepare a speech for each session.
__label__negative	The speaker didn't answer any of the questions.
__label__negative	All these are absurd rules
__label__neutral	With just one presenter it would have been enough
__label__negative	It is not the first time this was brought up and I don’t see any improvement.
__label__positive	I think that it was enough time for everything.
__label__negative	The speaker sounded like he had no idea about the case.
__label__negative	Be more specific about what you know and see in your team
__label__negative	 I’m of the opinion that the review was poor
__label__negative	For reasons of time it was impossible to complete the main theme of the meeting
__label__positive	A solemn meeting 
__label__neutral	I hope that sb would organize some sort of entertainment,
__label__negative	I don’t think we should change our organization units on these occasions.
__label__negative	Can anyone put the soup in the bathroom?
__label__negative	Can I ask you to finish your talk on time?
__label__negative	I couldn’t hear in the back of the room
__label__negative	After it all I was exhausted.
__label__negative	I would never use such words as the guy did.
__label__positive	After those meetings I always have so many new ideas.
__label__negative	I would change everything.
__label__neutral	I hope you have better tests for the next meeting
__label__neutral	I didn't get there on time, I'm sorry
__label__neutral	Let's call him and ask him to accompany us. 
__label__neutral	I think that it would be better to meet more often and make the meetings shorter.
__label__neutral	Can you remind me what was this all about?
__label__neutral	Meetings must be an exclusive tool, which is only used when strictly necessary.
__label__negative	The way he said it, he didn't find it interesting at all
__label__positive	She is very attentive to detail
__label__neutral	We all hope that the quality of information improves
__label__negative	I find those subjects not practical.
__label__negative	I was on time and there was nobody in the room.
__label__positive	 It seems to me that the major is working
__label__positive	He was such a wonderful person in so many ways.
__label__positive	I'm pleased with the captain's skills
__label__positive	It was incredible the possibility of giving an opinion at the meeting
__label__negative	The final part of the meeting was disagreeable
__label__neutral	Door to our meeting room need fixing.
__label__negative	Those chairs and tables are old and uncomfortable.
__label__neutral	I recommend you say what the agenda will be at the beginning of the meeting
__label__negative	Do you think you’ll convince people simply by repeating your version?
__label__negative	I saw an absurd ritual in that meeting
__label__positive	True, Navy does need to change in this aspect.
__label__neutral	The truth is we should promote this Navy-wide.
__label__positive	Finally somebody fixed the air conditioning.
__label__positive	It's hard to think of any things that the organizers can change.
__label__negative	There was no harmony in this meeting.
__label__negative	The speaker was a noisy guy.
__label__positive	He is a leader with charismatic ideas
__label__negative	It is really hard to focus with such noise outside the room.
__label__neutral	I would prefer to hear few words of explanation before presentation of the problem.
__label__positive	The proposed use the command center was interesting
__label__negative	I'm still not on the mailing list.
__label__neutral	Next time, a larger showroom would be much better.
__label__positive	We were all well informed for the first time.
__label__negative	 It goes without saying that the main idea was unsuccessful
__label__negative	I don’t think repeating the same story all over again will make it true.
__label__neutral	He needs to take out that phrase
__label__positive	Thanks for your time
__label__positive	He is an expert
__label__negative	In my opinion not everyone are involved enough during those sessions.
__label__positive	From my perspective the main idea presented in the course should be more often discussed.
__label__negative	After your speech we had to go for a beer.
__label__negative	The main presenter had a short time presentation
__label__positive	Congratulations, your talk was really inspiring!
__label__negative	I would never use such words as the presenter did.
__label__neutral	This, according to general Franco, would be inconvenient.
__label__negative	It was an awful meeting
__label__positive	Thanks meeting was very polite
__label__positive	If we go to such detail each time, will have finally a thorough view of the problem.
__label__positive	I'm glad that we discussed this topic today.
__label__positive	I'm glad that there was no technical problems during this session.
__label__negative	Do you homework next time!
__label__positive	Finally, a meeting where they do not extend with unimportant issues
__label__neutral	We should get sth to eat.
__label__positive	Great way of presenting.
__label__negative	Paying so much attention to occasional issues hinders our overall perception.
__label__neutral	Was this really about operations?
__label__negative	There's no time for such things.
__label__negative	No time to pee during breaks.
__label__neutral	I’m not sure if this is a right way.
__label__positive	An excellent idea that the people involved are summoned in advance and have sufficient information on the topics to treat
__label__negative	I entirely disagree with what was said.
__label__positive	The internet connection area was quite fast at the meeting place.
__label__neutral	It is also important to talk about deadlines, actions or responsible for future tasks
__label__positive	I would contend that the size of this problem is substantially smaller than many people would guess.
__label__negative	Please do not look at the cell phone while others speak.
__label__positive	I wish everyone had such meetings.
__label__positive	 In my view the plan was calm 
__label__neutral	We should ask him what he meant
__label__negative	I would never excuse such behavior.
__label__neutral	We should have a follow-up of the work meeting
__label__neutral	I wonder how long did you prepare for this presentation?
__label__neutral	I’d pay more attention to details.
__label__positive	Good job!
__label__negative	The chairs are very uncomfortable.
__label__positive	A leader is someone who knows the way, walks the way and shows the way. 
__label__positive	You handled the audience perfectly.
__label__neutral	How can we improve our execution?
__label__neutral	On one hand I understand your point, on the other hand I disagree
__label__neutral	There should be a leader who has enough sensitivity to identify how he can empower each component of his team.
__label__negative	We are always arguing during those meetings and nobody reacts.
__label__negative	The way that major was presenting guests was strongly inappropriate.
__label__negative	Can you believe he shouted at us?
__label__negative	One of the guys stood up and started shouting and nobody cared.
__label__positive	She is a fierce fighter
__label__positive	The catering was better.
__label__positive	You have really improved since our last meeting.
__label__positive	You are the most wonderful man.
__label__neutral	I would give certificates those who passed exams at the end
__label__negative	This was wrong, totally wrong, whatever we do, we should do it together.
__label__neutral	You should do something about the problem.
__label__neutral	Was the meeting supposed to begin at 12?
__label__positive	Those meetings give me hope for a change,
__label__negative	 From my perspective the proposed changes to WTO are absurd
__label__neutral	Someone should take care for sticking to the protocol.
__label__positive	I anticipated the delight of talking to my general 
__label__positive	I like the idea of seeing movies as material, we can use that way of learning more often.
__label__negative	Meeting so late is hard.
__label__negative	The presenter was poorly dressed.
__label__positive	I love our new phantoms.
__label__positive	For the most part, though, her presentation was interesting 
__label__negative	My daily duties would become much more tiring after this change.
__label__positive	I've never seen such a great speaker.
__label__negative	Unfortunately the speaker did not have time to close the idea
__label__positive	If all attendees are clear about the objectives and topics to be discussed, the meeting will be better
__label__negative	How u can survive without a microphone?
__label__neutral	 Could you post a detailed interpretation of that law?
__label__positive	I hope I would be invited again.
__label__negative	We don't need so many breaks.
__label__neutral	Are you sure no one would follow?
__label__neutral	He waited for the others to leave the command center
__label__neutral	Please avoid bringing family members to this kind of meetings
__label__negative	That was a mistake in the performance of his duty.
__label__positive	Now this is what I call a speech!
__label__neutral	Please leave something to take notes on
__label__positive	You started right on time which is appreciated.
__label__positive	The times coincided perfectly between each exhibition
__label__negative	I let Tom know that I was dissatisfied with his presentation
__label__negative	You should do more rehearsals before the meeting.
__label__positive	It's great and I love it.
__label__negative	The whole idea makes me feel sick!
__label__positive	Not often can you see such performance!
__label__neutral	If you focus on the main subject, you’ll get more attention.
__label__negative	Every single part started late than it was scheduled.
__label__negative	The practical part with exercises was too short.
__label__negative	If you expect us to be on time with our duties, then set an example!
__label__negative	I don't like discussing the same thing all the time.
__label__positive	I appreciate the assistance
__label__negative	 Some people say  the meeting was not useful because they heard already about the latter
__label__neutral	When was the course suppose to end?
__label__neutral	For next time go to the point and do not get off the subject.
__label__negative	I guess it would be better not to go into such detail.
__label__negative	Can anybody fix those chairs?
__label__negative	How on earth are we to achieve anything if we waste our time like this?!?!
__label__neutral	I would make tests after those lectures.
__label__negative	I see a need of being informed about the subject of the meeting earlier.
__label__positive	Amazing how easy it was for you to carry out an interesting meeting.
__label__negative	We had to wait 20 minutes after the agreed time.
__label__negative	One toilet isn't enough.
__label__positive	The meetings are important but have been discredited by the lack of specificity and organization around them
__label__negative	The meeting room was untidy.
__label__positive	I think the new way of handling these problems may be good.
__label__negative	The topics don’t vary enough.
__label__positive	I think the plan is credible
__label__negative	Considering the problems they presented, she could hardly blame him for that.
__label__neutral	We should have some impact on the results.
__label__neutral	 Generally it is thought that soldiers are nervous
__label__positive	They admired the idea very much, for they had never seen anything like it.
__label__negative	Not knowing before who would present was problematic
__label__neutral	Perhaps we could ask the general if he has permission to leave the base?
__label__neutral	Everyone should obey the rules of our sessions.
__label__neutral	Although you have all been to the same meeting, it is possible that there may be misunderstandings, it is important to make clear the conclusions and next steps
__label__neutral	We need someone to write down all the suggestions raised durin the session.
__label__positive	After changing the rules of the meeting it started to work.
__label__negative	 Some people say  the speaker is not credible
__label__negative	The presenter was speaking so fast that I wasn't able to write down my notes.
__label__positive	Great precision.
__label__neutral	That group should drop out 
__label__neutral	Next time please have better reasons
__label__neutral	I hope we have more participation in choosing the topic of the next meeting
__label__negative	I didn't like those yokes that the speaker used during presentation.
__label__positive	Very interesting.
__label__positive	He is an interesting man
__label__negative	He is always late.
__label__negative	The problem is we talk to little about this.
__label__negative	I hope he won't come here again
__label__negative	If the microphone is faulty it’s better not to use it….
__label__neutral	You need to remove their opinion
__label__neutral	I think that five minutes for every opinion is enough.
__label__negative	People asked unnecessary questions.
__label__negative	He should not listen to anyone who tried to persuade him to stay, he had his orders.
__label__negative	It was really upsetting to hear their story.
__label__negative	Waste of money and time.
__label__negative	Pure histrionics.
__label__positive	 I believe the plan is not negative
__label__positive	I feel the training was great
__label__positive	The speaker was great as always.
__label__neutral	My delight in them is as varied as my moods.
__label__neutral	Is Mr. Smith the one with that authority? 
__label__negative	I though that we can afford a microphone?!
__label__neutral	My guess it’s because we’re there for a long time already.
__label__positive	It's wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads!
__label__positive	Focusing on what is going well can help you discover ways to solve other situations
__label__neutral	There is an extraordinary session from October till Christmas.
__label__neutral	I fear we should do even more.
__label__neutral	Those windows without curtains make it impossible to see anything on the screen.
__label__negative	The way of presentation was ridiculous.
__label__positive	It was the highest time to discuss this topic.
__label__neutral	I would consider it useful to be introduced before such meetings.
__label__negative	Do we have some technical staff to help in emergencies at all?
__label__negative	Can't wee finally talk about something important in our work?
__label__positive	It is a great experience
__label__neutral	I’m not sure if I understood correctly.
__label__neutral	There should be a leader, someone who would give a right direction to all those discussions.
__label__neutral	It is important to understand more effectively the actions or circumstances that affect the work team.
__label__positive	He had the satisfaction of being the first to put it into operation.
__label__negative	 Some people say that the review process does not work
__label__negative	After a few minutes of looking for his file, he finally started
__label__neutral	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should have the right to vote.
__label__neutral	I suggest renewing our knowledge about first aid.
__label__neutral	What are the consequences of having such diversity in a work group?
__label__positive	He found the transition plan was well done
__label__negative	Maybe if we were given sth to eat it would be easier.
__label__negative	No words to describe my disapproval to what I saw.
__label__negative	The plan execution was marred by static characterizations
__label__negative	Reading and answering emails breaks the work dynamics a lot
__label__neutral	I remember similar topics covered in speeches during my initial training.
__label__positive	I was better today than it was during previous sessions.
__label__negative	I came in a few minutes after the meeting should have started, but there was no one in the room
__label__neutral	I expect my people to start on time.
__label__positive	Timely starting your meetings would be much appreciated.
__label__neutral	Someone should follow up on the commitments to make sure that they are really fulfill.
__label__negative	your worries have not been heard
__label__neutral	There is a fierce competition between these two entities
__label__neutral	Perhaps people would like to read those instructions
__label__neutral	I should like to be at home on Christmas day, but I actually don’t care.
__label__neutral	To be perfectly clear, I am not saying the Internet and technology will solve every human ill.
__label__negative	There wasn't time for everyone to speak their minds.
__label__negative	The presenter deviated from the main topic
__label__positive	I liked the way you talk.
__label__negative	It would be continual mistake to pursue this line
__label__negative	I don't need those sessions.
__label__neutral	I didn't have a pen.
__label__negative	I think he can do a better job
__label__neutral	I will make sure to send you a follow-up when this project is completed.
__label__positive	 According to me the talk was fierce
__label__negative	Waste of our time.
__label__neutral	We can search for some new inspiration and new subjects to discuss.
__label__negative	It was a total disaster.
__label__positive	It's hard to think of any cons.
__label__neutral	I think we should discuss urgent things.
__label__negative	The translation headphones had a connection failure, they did not allow me to understand the meaning of the words
__label__negative	So many hours without a break?
__label__negative	Do we have to use this broken chairs because someone is lazy or we lack funds?
__label__neutral	I'll suggest more time for answering questions.
__label__neutral	We can divide into groups by our own.
__label__neutral	How can this be achieved in the classroom?
__label__positive	It was a pleasure to take part in such event.
__label__neutral	Next time, please let us know in advance the day and time of the meeting
__label__negative	This meeting without access to WIFI was a mistake.
__label__positive	Hey, that was really well said!
__label__neutral	Maybe you’re right, but the more we spend on maintenance the less we spend on innovation.
__label__neutral	It is not wrong to remember the names of the people and the reasons why they participate in the meeting.
__label__positive	Many thanks for an interesting meeting.
__label__positive	I liked it tat we could practice with our quests.
__label__neutral	She should discuss all this with Alex.
__label__negative	For the next occasion we hope that the presenter invites the public to be part of the topic being discussed
__label__negative	 I’m of the opinion that the main idea was not great
__label__positive	What a wonderful story.
__label__neutral	I don’t know what to say.
__label__positive	O.K.
__label__negative	I don't like that way of presentation.
__label__neutral	I hope it would be improved.
__label__positive	The wi-fi finally works.
__label__negative	The chairs are absolutely not comfortable.
__label__negative	I didn't get what the speaker meant.
__label__neutral	I think that we should get access to the address book with contacts to other participants.
__label__neutral	I think that the microphone should be given to those who have something interesting to say.
__label__negative	The speaker got me really bored.
__label__neutral	I hope that next time we would again talk the same subject, because it wasn't exhausted during one meeting.
__label__negative	In another room it was extremely noisy and nobody reacted.
__label__negative	It's a pity that there was no time for comments from the quests.
__label__neutral	Water is everywhere essential to their well-being
__label__neutral	I recommend that you take a break
__label__neutral	If I had remembered this it would have prevented some mistakes
__label__neutral	What do you say if I help you next time?
__label__positive	That afternoon Christopher had a wonderful story to tell.
__label__negative	Maybe he should see a doctor.
__label__negative	The air conditioner didn't work.
__label__neutral	I would like to discuss ways to facilitate it.
__label__negative	Keep things simple.
__label__negative	Starting on 8.00 is too early for me.
__label__negative	This was a very boring meeting.
__label__negative	The translation was not heard.
__label__negative	Bad idea.
__label__positive	Everyone should see the video that was played during the meeting
__label__negative	I didn't hear most important things because of the microphone.
__label__positive	I love it that you've added the e-mail reminder.
__label__neutral	The meeting should have been canceled and and the matter should be dealt with in a more productive way.
__label__neutral	Try talking to the people seating in front of you next time, not to the room.
__label__negative	I don’t want to sit and watch such nonsense!
__label__neutral	My colleagues would prefer you talk a little slower.
__label__negative	A bit hesitating
__label__neutral	Maybe we should be given some materials before meetings?
__label__positive	I appreciate you taking the time from your busy schedule to talk to me.
__label__negative	It should be ready now, not in 2 months!
__label__negative	All the cables lying around the room are dangerous.
__label__neutral	The soldiers should follow procedures
__label__positive	You're a very interesting person
__label__neutral	Somebody should lock the door after the beginning.
__label__neutral	Using mobile phones should be forbidden.
__label__positive	After this meeting everyone had good mood!
__label__positive	I love the man, he has such a sense of humor.
__label__positive	 It goes without saying that the training was working
__label__negative	If I may, please keep your presentation to the subject more strictly!
__label__negative	The computer is very slow
__label__neutral	I think that wee need three more meetings on the same topic, because it was not enough time to talk everything thru.
__label__neutral	I have the impression you wanted to say something different.
__label__negative	The speaker was boring.
__label__negative	Please make things more readable on you slides next time!
__label__negative	There are members who answer emails, consult social networks or other tasks not related to the theme of the meeting
__label__negative	Im definitely not the only one who thinks  the speaker was not fierce
__label__neutral	Please, the organizers must identify the people who must participate.
__label__negative	The presenter did not review well the points that he was going to deal with
__label__positive	Everything was easy to understand, they really met my expectations.
__label__neutral	Don’t you think it is about time we change this?
__label__neutral	For the next meeting, I recommend presenting the work program by the previously disseminated agenda and remembering the objectives of the meeting.
__label__negative	Not enough team working.
__label__negative	Many ideas for so little time
__label__neutral	I felt myself very lucky to get time for my question
__label__positive	Without those meetings it would be harder to survive this time.
__label__neutral	I may be misunderstanding.
__label__neutral	One of the participants must be publicly responsible for recording in writing what was agreed at the meeting.
__label__neutral	Can the presenter do it?
__label__negative	It seemed to me that the guy that was giving the lecture was drunk.
__label__neutral	We were intrigued. 
__label__positive	The presented idea may be eligible for the “idea of the month” award
__label__positive	We listened with great interest.
__label__negative	Who proposed this topic for our session?!
__label__negative	These have been long and boring meetings
__label__positive	100% performance.
__label__negative	Everyone wanted to leave before you finished.
__label__positive	Good timing 
__label__positive	I'm really impressed.
__label__positive	I hope the commander can select the most suitable people to lead these meetings.
__label__negative	The presenter was speaking very fast because there was not enough time to cover all topics
__label__negative	Noises from the outside made it unbearable.
__label__neutral	Why should that cause the masses to riot?
__label__neutral	His delight in plans frequently appears in memorandums written to his soldiers during summer
__label__negative	 From my perspective the main idea is not working
__label__positive	 The talk was amazing
__label__neutral	For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed.
__label__neutral	I think that someone should take the responsibility for that accident that happened during our last meeting.
