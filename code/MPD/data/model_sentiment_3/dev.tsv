__label__negative	This meeting without access to WIFI was a mistake.
__label__negative	We’ll loose next war if everyone in the army cares about time so little as you do :(
__label__neutral	The newest data shows something different from what you were saying.
__label__negative	The lights are too bright.
__label__neutral	Try talking to the people seating in front of you next time, not to the room.
__label__negative	I couldn't focus on the case.
__label__neutral	I think that it would be better to meet more often and make the meetings shorter.
__label__negative	It was boring.
__label__negative	Too short breaks.
__label__neutral	I hope that next time we would again talk the same subject, because it wasn't exhausted during one meeting.
__label__negative	From my experience, I know that half of the meetings are considered unproductive by their attendees.
__label__negative	The way you’re putting this is awkward.
__label__negative	 I’m of the opinion that the main idea was not great
__label__neutral	Do you think everyone followed?
__label__negative	Do you think it was nice to listen to all this negative stuff?
__label__positive	The idea of meetings is good.
__label__positive	He is very kind to take the trouble to help me
__label__neutral	I would love to see a new face during those meetings.
__label__neutral	I can show you where that information stands out in the report and in the progress notes.
__label__negative	No words to describe my disapproval to what I saw.
__label__neutral	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should have the right to vote.
__label__neutral	This wasn’t great but wasn’t bad either.
__label__neutral	Please avoid bringing family members to this kind of meetings
__label__positive	Now this is what I call a speech!
__label__negative	The speakers were set so loudly that it really heart my ears!
__label__positive	It sounds like a real adventure!
__label__negative	Every single part started late than it was scheduled.
__label__positive	Everyone should see the video that was played during the meeting
__label__neutral	Wider room for us all.
__label__negative	I thought that wi-fi would be available.
__label__negative	It would be continual mistake to pursue this line
__label__positive	You're a very interesting person
__label__positive	I think the new way of handling these problems may be good.
__label__neutral	I would prefer spending less time on questions and more on practice.
__label__neutral	My guess it’s because we’re there for a long time already.
__label__negative	I’m not sure why but I feel this is wrong.
__label__neutral	More teacher for the practical part.
__label__positive	Great precision.
__label__neutral	Someone should take care for sticking to the protocol.
__label__negative	The proposed frequency is to high, it will cause trouble.
__label__positive	I envy u such meetings.
__label__neutral	You should work on your pronunciation of foreign words.
__label__positive	She made every possible effort to explain everything.
__label__negative	The translation headphones had a connection failure, they did not allow me to understand the meaning of the words
__label__negative	Could someone fix the microphone?
__label__positive	I really appreciated that you’ve finished on time.
__label__negative	I couldn’t stop looking at the clock, I wanted to get out so quickly!
__label__negative	After your speech we had to go for a beer.
__label__neutral	We should get something to drink, while sitting those long hours.
__label__neutral	Why should we bother if there is more CTO then DAS?
__label__negative	The chairs are absolutely not comfortable.
__label__positive	I hope your colleagues were also that punctual.
__label__positive	His delight is to know the law and show it to everyone
__label__neutral	I think that five minutes for every opinion is enough.
__label__negative	Technical problems delaying the whole meeting for so long shouldn't ever happen.
__label__positive	The commander expressed enthusiasm towards new goals
__label__positive	Every dead soldier has a face, a story, and a bereaved family
__label__neutral	I would suggest for us to find a consultant next time when we will discuss such tough things.
__label__negative	The presentation on the computer was quite dense
__label__neutral	We should have some impact on the results.
__label__neutral	The reasone for MTO to express such opinion was obvious.
__label__positive	 Generally it is thought that the review was not unfortunate
__label__neutral	You should do something about the problem.
__label__positive	The catering was better.
__label__positive	The meetings are important but have been discredited by the lack of specificity and organization around them
__label__positive	 According to me the major was good
__label__neutral	I’m not sure if I understood correctly.
__label__negative	I did not like his plan and they way he put things on display
__label__positive	He is a leader with charismatic ideas
__label__positive	A young and innovative thinking according to the trend of your market.
__label__negative	Prevent the commitments made at the meeting from being forgotten.
__label__negative	Too many abbreviations.
__label__negative	All the cables lying around the room are dangerous.
__label__neutral	We should think about some new topic, more up to date.
__label__negative	 From my perspective the main idea is not working
__label__neutral	It is not wrong to remember the names of the people and the reasons why they participate in the meeting.
__label__negative	I totally disagree.
__label__negative	It is hard to expect anyone to keep focused after a whole hour of densely-packed presentation.
__label__positive	I feel the training was great
__label__neutral	You need to remove their opinion
__label__positive	The internet connection area was quite fast at the meeting place.
__label__negative	The topics don’t vary enough.
__label__negative	Waste of our time.
__label__negative	Not knowing before who would present was problematic
__label__negative	 From my perspective the commander not was good
__label__positive	I liked that they organized the entire process in an orderly manner along with the necessary materials and classrooms.
__label__neutral	Let's call him and ask him to accompany us. 
__label__positive	The times coincided perfectly between each exhibition
__label__negative	The presenter left no time to ask questions
__label__negative	 I’m of the opinion that the review was poor
__label__positive	 In my view the plan was calm 
__label__negative	For the next meeting we hope to start and end the meeting at the planned hours
__label__neutral	To be perfectly clear, I am not saying the Internet and technology will solve every human ill.
__label__positive	Government is a great achievement of civilization.
__label__neutral	In the ancient world, man wanted guidance from the gods on what he should do.
__label__negative	I was hoping to hear more about this idea.
__label__negative	One toilet isn't enough.
__label__neutral	Better write an email to everyone. Work meetings are a big problem for many organizations
__label__neutral	I don't know what to say.
__label__negative	I don’t think repeating the same story all over again will make it true.
__label__negative	Can't wee finally talk about something important in our work?
__label__neutral	They should know better how to react in such situations in future.
__label__positive	It was incredible the possibility of giving an opinion at the meeting
__label__negative	It is a very small space for those meetings with so many people.
__label__neutral	I think that wee need three more meetings on the same topic, because it was not enough time to talk everything thru.
__label__negative	I don't find pleasure in wasting time.
__label__negative	You should do more rehearsals before the meeting.
__label__negative	Everyone wanted to leave before you finished.
__label__negative	We had to wait 20 minutes after the agreed time.
__label__positive	The wi-fi finally works.
__label__negative	The speaker sounded like he had no idea about the case.
__label__positive	Hey, that was really well said!
__label__positive	Could you imagine how wonderful it actually was?
__label__neutral	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should be given some materials from it.
__label__neyutral	The way of presenting the topic was surprising.
__label__negative	I couldn’t hear in the back of the room
__label__positive	It was a pleasure to help you.
__label__negative	Can anyone put the soup in the bathroom?
__label__negative	 I’m of the opinion that the lecture is boring
__label__negative	I think the commander was depressing
__label__negative	Totally not useful meeting and topic.
__label__negative	The room was in a mass as always.
__label__positive	Very nice meeting!
__label__negative	Too many not answered questions.
__label__neutral	I see a strong need to make some new rules during our sessions.
__label__neutral	Somebody who is not interested should have the right not to participate.
__label__negative	I hated it.
__label__neutral	My impression was that you didn’t want to tell us the whole story.
__label__negative	 It goes without saying that the main idea was unsuccessful
__label__negative	I guess it would be better not to go into such detail.
__label__negative	I didn't hear most important things because of the microphone.
__label__neutral	I also have something to say in today’s topic.
__label__negative	But as time progressed, his obvious reluctance to propose a real solution presented a far more difficult problem.
__label__negative	People were bored
__label__negative	I hoped to get some more details, e-mail address or anything, from the speaker.
__label__positive	I like the idea of seeing movies as material, we can use that way of learning more often.
__label__negative	I don't like discussing the same thing all the time.
__label__neutral	Was this really about operations?
__label__positive	If all attendees are clear about the objectives and topics to be discussed, the meeting will be better
__label__neutral	Dean presented the facts unemotionally but as soon as he mentioned Scranton, the old man caught the coincidence and could hardly contain himself.
__label__positive	Excellent work in the given time span.
__label__neutral	He needs to take out that phrase
__label__negative	The computers in the room are very old.
__label__negative	After it all I was exhausted.
__label__neutral	She should discuss all this with Alex.
__label__negative	we do not agree with that recommendation
__label__neutral	I hope you have better tests for the next meeting
__label__neutral	If you focus on the main subject, you’ll get more attention.
__label__negative	If you complicate things don’t be surprised people don’t listen.
__label__negative	If the microphone is faulty it’s better not to use it….
__label__neutral	 It seemed like the commander was hungry
__label__negative	All these are absurd rules
__label__negative	The presenter repeated the same thing he said during the last meetings
__label__positive	I think the plan is credible
__label__positive	The proposed use the command center was interesting
__label__negative	I would never use such words as the presenter did.
__label__negative	I was horrified.
__label__positive	It's hard to think of any cons.
__label__positive	I would contend that the size of this problem is substantially smaller than many people would guess.
__label__neutral	Everyone should be involved.
__label__neutral	In meetings, delays should not be allowed unless they are for a greater cause.
__label__negative	Meeting so early is nearly impossible for me.
__label__neutral	I felt myself very lucky to get time for my question
__label__positive	It was a pleasure to hear such a good speech.
__label__positive	 From my perspective the competition was excellent
__label__neutral	All the participants should be provided with good equipment.
__label__negative	your worries have not been heard
__label__negative	How on earth are we to achieve anything if we waste our time like this?!?!
__label__negative	It would cost a million dollars and not even be as good as a our own product
__label__neutral	I’m not sure if going into such detail is useful.
__label__negative	I didn’t like the topic.
__label__neutral	I would prefer to hear few words of explanation before presentation of the problem.
__label__positive	This time both arguments were presented 
__label__negative	I didn't like those yokes that the speaker used during presentation.
__label__neutral	Please, the organizers must identify the people who must participate.
__label__positive	O.K.
__label__positive	The didactic content made everything much easier, it was amazing
__label__positive	The meeting leader can continue to improve aspects of the meeting by concluding at the end of each meeting.
__label__neutral	Before the meeting, the presenter should check that his objectives are clear and justify his need
__label__neutral	I think that we should get access to the address book with contacts to other participants.
