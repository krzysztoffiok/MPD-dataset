__label__neutral	I fully am aware of the topic, but the rest isn’t
__label__positive	He is an expert
__label__negative	Can you believe he shouted at us?
__label__negative	I think he is an unfortunate person
__label__negative	I thought that we would discuss this topic and vote, but it didn't happen.
__label__positive	 Some people say that the meeting wasn’t boring
__label__neutral	I think that changing the speaker would help.
__label__neutral	Punctuality of the members is fundamental
__label__negative	In my opinion five minutes is too short.
__label__positive	I know how much time and effort you have invested not only to do the project before the deadline, but to ensure that everyone is satisfied with each step of the process.
__label__negative	Because the boredom of the lecture made me drowsy
__label__negative	Instead of getting angry, be practical.
__label__positive	I wish everyone had such meetings.
__label__neutral	Maybe it's not so hard to organize some catering.
__label__negative	I don't like discussing the same thing all the time.
__label__negative	I have noticed that at the end of the day, Olivia is not able to focus on her task without despair.
__label__negative	The chairs are absolutely not comfortable.
__label__neutral	Somebody should clean the room before the session.
__label__neutral	We need charismatic leaders in such situations
__label__neutral	The soldiers would cross the river.
__label__positive	I appreciated all the examples
__label__neutral	Everyone should obey the rules of our sessions.
__label__neutral	I didn't get there on time, I'm sorry
__label__positive	The new pointers were really helpful during the presentation.
__label__positive	Not often can you see such performance!
__label__neutral	If you disagree with someone, express it in a kind and respectful manner, that is, challenge the idea and not the person.
__label__negative	Do you think it was nice to listen to all this negative stuff?
__label__neutral	We should think about some new topic, more up to date.
__label__neutral	It is also important to talk about deadlines, actions or responsible for future tasks
__label__positive	The idea of meetings is good.
__label__positive	The exhibitor allowed to advance the topic clearly and with good timing, without losing the main rithm of each subject
__label__neutral	I’m not sure if going into such detail is useful.
__label__neutral	Usually there is not enough men for the job.
__label__negative	She had a suspicious behavior
__label__negative	It was an awful meeting
__label__neutral	My guess it’s because we’re there for a long time already.
__label__negative	Productivity was affected by external factors such as lack of good sound
__label__negative	The presenter left no time to ask questions
__label__neutral	I recommend that you take a break
__label__positive	A very nice presentation.
__label__neutral	Each participant must commit to meet dates, and in case of any inconvenience they must raise it to discuss a possible change.
__label__neutral	It is useful to have someone who has had experience with similar problems in previous projects to talk to.
__label__negative	The man spoke in a quiet, but nervous voice.
__label__neutral	You should work on your pronunciation of foreign words.
__label__positive	She discussed and interacted with soldiers
__label__negative	I didn’t like the topic.
__label__positive	I would contend that the size of this problem is substantially smaller than many people would guess.
__label__positive	You engaged the audience 
__label__neutral	May I suggest to have hangouts and coffee?
__label__neutral	AWS should not play any part in the decision making process.
__label__neutral	I hope that next time we would again talk the same subject, because it wasn't exhausted during one meeting.
__label__negative	I had an impression that the speaker wasn't sober.
__label__negative	 I’m of the opinion that the review was poor
__label__positive	I liked it tat we could practice with our quests.
__label__negative	I had problems focusing my attention.
__label__negative	No one has such old machines to practice.
__label__neutral	I finally understood what you mean in the very last minutes of your speech.
__label__negative	He should use the microphone!!!!!
__label__negative	With all due respect, this was horrible.
__label__neutral	I think that it would be better if we divided time on practical part and lecture.
__label__neutral	We need a leader, chairman… someone to menage the meeting.
__label__positive	Thank you very much for such a nice meeting
__label__negative	If we did what he proposed, we wouldn’t get far.
__label__neutral	Meetings must be an exclusive tool, which is only used when strictly necessary.
__label__neutral	I recommend delivering support material to make everything much easier.
__label__negative	The meeting was extended leaving us with little time for the most important part
__label__negative	A little advice: keep it short!
__label__neutral	We should be awarded for active participation.
__label__neutral	You should replay that part and see it for yourself
__label__positive	I had a very wonderful time at the meeting
__label__negative	 In my eyes the commander is not working
__label__negative	He cannot accomplish all of the agenda items during the allotted time
__label__negative	The speaker didn't answer any of the questions.
__label__negative	People were bored
__label__negative	Can anyone put the soup in the bathroom?
__label__positive	The sound of the place was really adequate, everything was heard perfect
__label__negative	I don't like that way of presentation.
__label__negative	The presenter did not review well the points that he was going to deal with
__label__positive	I think the plan is credible
__label__neutral	To be perfectly clear, I am not saying the Internet and technology will solve every human ill.
__label__neutral	I would suggest thinking about better coffee during breaks.
__label__negative	I couldn’t stop looking at the clock, I wanted to get out so quickly!
__label__negative	The proposed frequency is to high, it will cause trouble.
__label__neutral	 It seemed like the commander was hungry
__label__positive	I'm really impressed.
__label__positive	I appreciate the assistance
__label__neutral	I would prefer spending less time on questions and more on practice.
__label__positive	O.K.
__label__neutral	He waited for the others to leave the command center
__label__negative	The lights are too bright.
__label__positive	True, Navy does need to change in this aspect.
__label__positive	Suddenly there was a great news
__label__positive	A look of satisfaction spread over the face of the creature before her.
__label__positive	Great precision.
__label__neutral	Somebody should lock the door after the beginning.
__label__negative	We’ll loose next war if everyone in the army cares about time so little as you do :(
__label__neutral	With just one presenter it would have been enough
__label__negative	I don't need those sessions.
__label__negative	I don't agree to give my e-mail address.
__label__neutral	We can search for some new inspiration and new subjects to discuss.
__label__neutral	Everyone should prepare a speech for each session.
__label__negative	Do we have to use this broken chairs because someone is lazy or we lack funds?
__label__negative	We would never achieve anything with such speakers.
__label__positive	It was not difficult, however, to make her understand that there was a present for each soldier, and to her great delight she was permitted to hand the gifts to them
__label__positive	Starting and finishing on time was appreciated.
__label__negative	The guy that organized it should get fired at once!
__label__positive	I'm glad that we discussed this topic today.
__label__negative	Can anybody fix those chairs?
__label__neutral	We should be given a tablet or laptop during those sessions.
__label__neutral	His delight in plans frequently appears in memorandums written to his soldiers during summer
__label__negative	The translation was not heard.
__label__negative	Jhon appeared not the worse for the session, but he seemed ready for a nap.
__label__neutral	I expect my people to start on time.
__label__positive	I love our new phantoms.
__label__negative	 From my perspective the commander not was good
__label__neutral	I don't know what to say.
__label__neutral	Please, the organizers must identify the people who must participate.
__label__neutral	Next time, a larger showroom would be much better.
__label__negative	The chairs are very uncomfortable.
__label__neutral	Don’t you think it is about time we change this?
__label__neutral	If I had remembered this it would have prevented some mistakes
__label__positive	Thanks to that meetings I'm in better mood.
__label__negative	I suggest changing the speaker.
__label__negative	Please do your homework next time.
__label__positive	It was the highest time to discuss this topic.
__label__neutral	We should have a follow-up of the work meeting
__label__positive	If we go to such detail each time, will have finally a thorough view of the problem.
__label__neutral	Okay, you think that won't work for Olivia. 
__label__neutral	Next time please have better reasons
__label__positive	The commander showed focus on the subject 
__label__negative	Those attending these meetings see them as trivial and unimportant events.
__label__negative	"A new meeting without results and focused on ""technical aspects""."
__label__positive	"Thank you for preparing a ""report"" with the conclusions and agreements reached."
__label__neutral	We should encourage more behavior like this.
__label__neutral	 If the nation goes to war, the military would need more of these devices
__label__neutral	We should ask him what he meant
__label__negative	The computer is very slow
__label__positive	The presenter achieved each and every one of his goals
__label__negative	The air conditioner didn't work.
__label__neutral	Women should have different task than men.
__label__positive	Great way of presenting.
__label__neutral	You need to include someone who is able to take decisions about staff and financing
__label__negative	I guess it would be better not to go into such detail.
__label__positive	The catering was better.
__label__negative	I don't believe that it will change anything.
__label__negative	The plan execution was marred by static characterizations
__label__negative	The problem is we talk to little about this.
__label__neutral	Maybe some materials would help.
__label__neutral	It is important to understand more effectively the actions or circumstances that affect the work team.
__label__neutral	I would give certificates those who passed exams at the end
__label__positive	I liked the topic.
__label__negative	She likes depressing stories
__label__neutral	For next time go to the point and do not get off the subject.
__label__neutral	It is not wrong to remember the names of the people and the reasons why they participate in the meeting.
__label__neutral	We should get something to drink, while sitting those long hours.
__label__positive	He was flexible with the questions
__label__neutral	I was a little late and I wasn't allowed to join the meeting.
__label__positive	Good as always.
__label__positive	Good job!
__label__neutral	In the ancient world, man wanted guidance from the gods on what he should do.
__label__negative	If this is what the Navy thinks i’m terrified.
__label__positive	It's not the first time that the organizer was late.
__label__positive	Your description of the problem was thorough.
__label__positive	Finally somebody fixed the air conditioning.
__label__positive	Finally, everything has come together and we are ready to open the doors to the public.
__label__negative	No place to charge our laptops!
__label__positive	I really appreciated that you’ve finished on time.
__label__positive	We saw a great performance last night.
__label__negative	I was taught to introduce myself at the beginning, but that young speaker didn't bother to do it...
__label__negative	Too short breaks.
__label__positive	Very nice meeting!
__label__positive	Finally it wasn't so hot in the place.
__label__negative	The middle of the day is not the best time for such meetings.
__label__negative	Great job.
__label__positive	I was amazed.
__label__positive	I appreciate that the necessary times and schedules are planned, avoiding any excess that inhibits motivation
__label__negative	The way you’re putting this is awkward.
__label__positive	When the opportunity presented itself, she grabbed it and make us listen to her story.
__label__neutral	Using mobile phones should be forbidden.
__label__positive	I'm glad that there was no technical problems during this session.
__label__neutral	Some of the participants should get a reprimand.
__label__neutral	I don’t understand.
__label__neutral	I can show you where that information stands out in the report and in the progress notes.
__label__positive	The speaker was great as always.
__label__negative	I did not like his plan and they way he put things on display
__label__positive	You started right on time which is appreciated.
__label__neutral	And to this day, millions of people remember and honor the name of Gautama, as that of the great lover of men.
__label__positive	You are a valuable member of our team, and I really appreciate your contributions!
__label__neutral	Please send a list of topics to cover 24 hours in advance.
__label__neutral	I liked more the second part of the meeting.
__label__neutral	There are not enough windows that we could open, it was hard to breathe.
__label__negative	 I hold the view that the remarks presented during the speech were unfortunate
__label__neutral	We can divide into groups by our own.
__label__neutral	The truth is we should promote this Navy-wide.
__label__positive	You finished just before the time was over, good job.
__label__positive	Excellent meeting a time well spent
__label__neutral	I think the real problem is elsewhere.
__label__negative	I couldn’t hear in the back of the room
__label__negative	The speakers were set so loudly that it really heart my ears!
__label__positive	The wi-fi finally works.
__label__negative	It is hard to expect anyone to keep focused after a whole hour of densely-packed presentation.
__label__negative	It was really upsetting to hear their story.
__label__positive	I really liked your presentation.
__label__negative	You should do a better job next time
__label__neutral	I think that sticking to the schedule is not so important as answering all the questions.
__label__negative	Can I ask you to finish your talk on time?
__label__negative	The general showed a negative disposition  
__label__negative	Every time I'm just looking forward for the end of that meeting.
__label__neutral	If I were you, I would do more slides with better figures
__label__negative	The presenter was speaking very fast because there was not enough time to cover all topics
__label__positive	I must say this was amazing!
__label__negative	Maybe he should see a doctor.
__label__neutral	There should be a leader who has enough sensitivity to identify how he can empower each component of his team.
__label__positive	The commander expressed enthusiasm towards new goals
__label__positive	Challenging.
__label__negative	Not knowing before who would present was problematic
__label__negative	He should have faced the existing constrains and react promptly to lack of NDO
__label__negative	I hated it.
__label__negative	I though that we can afford a microphone?!
__label__negative	Waste of our time.
__label__neutral	I didn't realize that we are in such situation.
__label__neutral	Better write an email to everyone. Work meetings are a big problem for many organizations
__label__neutral	I may be misunderstanding.
__label__negative	How u can survive without a microphone?
__label__neutral	Perhaps we could ask the general if he has permission to leave the base?
__label__neutral	We need someone to write down all the suggestions raised durin the session.
__label__negative	The technical services must meet the particular needs of the participants
__label__positive	I appreciate you started on time.
__label__neutral	I didn't have a pen.
__label__negative	Who proposed this topic for our session?!
__label__negative	I hope he won't come here again
__label__negative	I think that one meeting to discuss the whole idea wasn't enough.
__label__positive	There's never too late to learn something more.
__label__positive	If all meetings were like this, I’d love to come more often.
__label__positive	It's great and I love it.
__label__neutral	Everyone should be involved.
__label__positive	Then with great labor he began to widen the passageway and everyone moved.
__label__negative	I don’t think this can be achieved.
__label__negative	Noises from the outside made it unbearable.
__label__negative	 Some people say that the review process does not work
__label__positive	 It goes without saying that the training was working
__label__neutral	Better leave us 15 minutes of questions and 15 minutes of opinions.
__label__negative	You divided the problem in 4 groups, but I think 6 would do better.
__label__negative	Our main case wasn't discussed at all.
__label__negative	I was horrified.
__label__positive	The times coincided perfectly between each exhibition
__label__negative	Meeting so early is nearly impossible for me.
__label__negative	It seemed to me that the guy that was giving the lecture was drunk.
__label__negative	I liked the topic but the presenting guy didn't manage to make me interested in listening.
__label__negative	If you present only general information, it is hard to imagine what the real problem is.
__label__positive	After changing the rules of the meeting it started to work.
__label__negative	I couldn't focus on the case.
__label__positive	He explained with great detail
__label__negative	I see a need of being informed about the subject of the meeting earlier.
__label__neutral	One of the participants must be publicly responsible for recording in writing what was agreed at the meeting.
__label__negative	All these are absurd rules
__label__neutral	Someone should follow up on the commitments to make sure that they are really fulfill.
__label__neutral	She should discuss all this with Alex.
__label__negative	I would change everything.
__label__neutral	Those meetings should be obligatory for all the staff.
__label__neutral	He needs to take out that phrase
__label__neutral	He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum
__label__positive	The more I think about what you’ve said the more I feel intrigued.
__label__positive	His talk was amazing
__label__positive	He is always consistent
__label__neutral	I recommend having a better dress by the exhibitors.
__label__positive	The speech was charismatic and inspired many listeners
__label__positive	A leader is someone who knows the way, walks the way and shows the way. 
__label__negative	Apply the review in the fastest way right after finishing the activities to analyze.
__label__positive	Could you imagine how wonderful it actually was?
__label__neutral	I would plan those meetings more in advance.
__label__negative	This was a very boring meeting.
__label__neutral	I would like to discuss ways to facilitate it.
__label__negative	Meeting so late is hard.
__label__neutral	Water is everywhere essential to their well-being
__label__neutral	There is an extraordinary session from October till Christmas.
__label__negative	At the meeting, the sound was not good
__label__positive	As for first session it wasn't bad.
__label__negative	Maybe if we were given sth to eat it would be easier.
__label__negative	We are always arguing during those meetings and nobody reacts.
__label__negative	Hopefully, this was his one and only session with drinking too much.
__label__positive	The story you told us is a good example.
__label__negative	Prevent the commitments made at the meeting from being forgotten.
__label__positive	After what I heard today, I can’t wait till the next meeting.
__label__positive	I loved it
__label__positive	You handled the audience perfectly.
__label__negative	And again no results.
__label__neutral	I recommend carrying out activities that encourage everyone's collaboration and participation to achieve the defined objective.
__label__neutral	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should have the right to vote.
__label__neutral	Let's call him and ask him to accompany us. 
__label__negative	The meeting took a long time.
__label__positive	Let's talk about what is working.
__label__neutral	I remember similar topics covered in speeches during my initial training.
__label__negative	Don’t chat during the presentations
__label__positive	Great performance!
__label__positive	They admired the idea very much, for they had never seen anything like it.
__label__neutral	Someone should take care for sticking to the protocol.
__label__neutral	In meetings, delays should not be allowed unless they are for a greater cause.
__label__positive	Today's topic is better than that of the previous meeting
__label__negative	The place was inappropriate.
__label__positive	I think the new way of handling these problems may be good.
__label__neutral	This wasn’t great but wasn’t bad either.
__label__positive	It was a pleasure to help you.
__label__negative	We all started arguing and nobody reacted and took care of the situation.
__label__negative	From my experience, I know that half of the meetings are considered unproductive by their attendees.
__label__positive	Thank you very much for meeting with me yesterday regarding my current project.
__label__neutral	Alex should have told you all this.
__label__positive	Thank you so much for your help
__label__positive	You've taken a great deal off my shoulders, and I appreciate it.
__label__positive	The presented idea may be eligible for the “idea of the month” award
__label__negative	 From my perspective the main idea is not working
__label__negative	I was late in my office because of the delay in the presentation.
__label__neutral	I’d really like to write something polite regarding this presentation.
__label__neutral	On the contrary, I think our mission is to protect them.
__label__positive	The presenter projects a good professional image.
__label__negative	It was too short.
__label__positive	A very good topic.
__label__negative	The room is too small.
__label__negative	The presenter was poorly dressed.
__label__positive	I would love to listen to the same prelection again.
__label__positive	I didn't realize that our meetings can solve so many problems.
__label__neutral	Was the meeting supposed to begin at 12?
__label__negative	The way that major was presenting guests was strongly inappropriate.
__label__neutral	Why should we bother if there is more CTO then DAS?
__label__positive	Great project, i’ll keep my fingers crossed for you!
__label__positive	If all attendees are clear about the objectives and topics to be discussed, the meeting will be better
__label__neutral	I think that five minutes for every opinion is enough.
__label__negative	It was so crowdy today that it was hard to breath.
__label__positive	Participants had time to ask questions and discuss them. 
__label__neutral	Please avoid bringing family members to this kind of meetings
__label__neutral	I also have something to say in today’s topic.
__label__positive	The proposed use the command center was interesting
__label__negative	People asked unnecessary questions.
__label__positive	The data regarding Afganistan was really up to date.
__label__negative	Starting on 8.00 is too early for me.
__label__negative	I don’t think repeating the same story all over again will make it true.
__label__positive	I'm pleased with the captain's skills
__label__negative	I think that we are worth more comfortable place for meetings.
__label__neutral	I wonder how long did you prepare for this presentation?
__label__negative	I don’t want to sit and watch such nonsense!
__label__neutral	I strongly recommend having lunches early
__label__neutral	I hope we have more participation in choosing the topic of the next meeting
__label__neutral	We should work more on this.
__label__positive	Thank you for offering to jointly coordinate the Hospitality Committee.
__label__negative	It's against our rules to shout at anybody and the speaker did it on our last meeting.
__label__negative	Do you behave like this on all meetings?
__label__negative	Too many not answered questions.
__label__positive	I hope your colleagues were also that punctual.
__label__negative	the soldiers demonstrate disinterest in current assignments
__label__positive	The attendees had the relevant data for the meeting.
__label__positive	The arguments that the major choose were convincing.
__label__neutral	I recall seeing this somewhere already.
__label__neutral	Door to our meeting room need fixing.
__label__positive	Everything was easy to understand, they really met my expectations.
__label__neutral	You should do something about the problem.
__label__positive	We listened with great interest.
__label__negative	After those meetings I always have a headache.
__label__neutral	You better don’t talk so much or you will get boring
__label__negative	I didn't have a place to sit.
__label__negative	You should remind people to turn off their mobiles.
__label__positive	I've never seen such a great speaker.
__label__positive	A pity not everyone knows how to be as punctual as you are!
__label__neutral	The topics could vary more between themselves.
__label__neutral	The meeting should have been canceled and and the matter should be dealt with in a more productive way.
__label__neutral	They should carry out more activities for public participation
__label__negative	I came in a few minutes after the meeting should have started, but there was no one in the room
__label__neutral	There should be a leader, someone who would give a right direction to all those discussions.
__label__neutral	I hope someone is responsible for writing an email that recapitulates everything, orders ideas and prevents possible errors or confusion
__label__neutral	Perhaps people would like to read those instructions
__label__negative	The meeting was full of topics that were simply not interesting
__label__negative	 From my perspective the proposed changes to WTO are absurd
__label__neutral	More attention to the matter would surely help.
__label__positive	Good conclusions are always important
__label__negative	Require attendees not to interrupt others.
__label__neutral	I would consider it useful to be introduced before such meetings.
__label__negative	The chain of command was not working
__label__negative	The simple facts should be so much more convincing!
__label__negative	 It goes without saying that the main idea was unsuccessful
__label__positive	 The talk was amazing
__label__positive	You are the most wonderful man.
__label__positive	After those meetings I always have so many new ideas.
__label__negative	There are members who answer emails, consult social networks or other tasks not related to the theme of the meeting
__label__neutral	I don’t know what to say.
__label__positive	Now that is quality!
__label__neutral	Maybe we could invite some quests?
__label__neutral	I think there are many things to change.
__label__negative	Considering the problems they presented, she could hardly blame him for that.
__label__neutral	 I guess frequent talking with people about such issues is working
__label__positive	 It seems to me that the major is working
__label__positive	I have nothing to complain about.
__label__positive	 I’m of the opinion that the talk was not boring
__label__neutral	What if next time we could just invite the important people?
__label__positive	You have really improved since our last meeting.
__label__neutral	Start at the announced time (at most, save 15 minutes of courtesy if many people are missing)
__label__positive	This time both arguments were presented 
__label__neutral	When was the course suppose to end?
__label__negative	Too long breaks.
__label__negative	I didn't fall asleep but I was close to it.
__label__positive	The attention he garnered amazed him.
__label__negative	We didn’t understand.
__label__positive	I had a wonderful time at the meeting
__label__neutral	The mentioned institutions should give more advice.
__label__negative	It was boring.
__label__positive	Great talk
__label__positive	Government is a great achievement of civilization.
__label__negative	Can't wee finally talk about something important in our work?
__label__negative	Every time the speaker has a problem with the computer.
__label__negative	She realizes  the commander was absurd
__label__neutral	There should be no selective reduction.
__label__negative	I think he can do a better job
__label__neutral	Although you have all been to the same meeting, it is possible that there may be misunderstandings, it is important to make clear the conclusions and next steps
__label__negative	I would prefer to hear some new information, not things that we all already know.
__label__positive	I really appreciate all your help preparing the meeting for the opening night.
__label__negative	I don’t like the idea of ​​checking every fifteen minutes if Olivia continues to do the homework
__label__positive	You get to meet all kinds of interesting people in that meeting
__label__neutral	More teacher for the practical part.
__label__negative	The microphone was not working well
__label__negative	Not enough team working.
__label__negative	Do you homework next time!
__label__neutral	Why should that cause the masses to riot?
__label__positive	I liked the story about general McKenzee
__label__neutral	I felt myself very lucky to get time for my question
__label__negative	I can imagine more useful skills that we can learn.
__label__negative	I thought that wi-fi would be available.
__label__positive	His delight is to know the law and show it to everyone
__label__positive	You expresses  concentration  
__label__negative	After it all I was exhausted.
__label__negative	He should not listen to anyone who tried to persuade him to stay, he had his orders.
__label__negative	The video beam was damaged.
__label__negative	Im definitely not the only one who thinks  the speaker was not fierce
__label__neutral	I think that we've run out with the subjects.
__label__positive	This presenter knows how to make a good meeting.
__label__neutral	The major shares information with peers and supervisors
__label__negative	There was no harmony in this meeting.
__label__neutral	I like watching films during presentation, why don’t we see more of them?
__label__neutral	May I suggest that we postpone discussing this until the next meeting?
__label__positive	 From my perspective the competition was excellent
__label__neutral	This, according to general Franco, would be inconvenient.
__label__positive	I like the idea of seeing movies as material, we can use that way of learning more often.
__label__negative	Technical problems delaying the whole meeting for so long shouldn't ever happen.
__label__negative	Be more specific about what you know and see in your team
__label__negative	 I’m of the opinion that the meeting was not interesting
__label__positive	 I liked how the themes were synthesized.
__label__positive	He found the transition plan was well done
__label__negative	It was very long.
__label__negative	The presentation was very subjective and emotional.
__label__positive	 Generally it is thought that the review was not unfortunate
__label__negative	I didn't think they would come and start so soon.
__label__positive	She helps without begin asked
__label__positive	It was a pleasure to hear such a good speech.
__label__neutral	I think we should find a new way of discussing our stuff.
__label__negative	The way he said it, he didn't find it interesting at all
__label__negative	The presenter mixed the topics.
__label__negative	I don’t think we should change our organization units on these occasions.
__label__positive	It's easier to spend all those hours in the room after the renovation.
__label__negative	For the next meeting we hope to start and end the meeting at the planned hours
__label__negative	If I may, please keep your presentation to the subject more strictly!
__label__positive	100% performance.
__label__neutral	There we have command and power in their primary form
__label__negative	I will not attend such meetings in the future.
__label__negative	It is important to be constructive always
__label__neutral	For the next meeting please bring a mouse to the computers.
__label__negative	I don't find pleasure in wasting time.
__label__positive	The meeting resulted in a laugh of inexpressible satisfaction
__label__negative	The whole idea makes me feel sick!
__label__neutral	If you focus on the main subject, you’ll get more attention.
__label__neutral	She was wired with a different kind of energy after the sparring session
__label__neutral	There is a fierce competition between these two entities
__label__neutral	I’m not sure if you give rewards for such small efforts will it bring any good?
__label__negative	Please make things more readable on you slides next time!
__label__positive	Writing an act helps to remember.
__label__neutral	We all hope that the quality of information improves
__label__negative	The sound was too loud.
__label__positive	The meetings are important but have been discredited by the lack of specificity and organization around them
__label__positive	Suddenly there was a great topic
__label__positive	it's a long conversation about what's going wrong
__label__neutral	I always have a problem with preparing my speech.
__label__negative	Too many digressions.
__label__negative	Bad idea.
__label__positive	Finally, a meeting where they do not extend with unimportant issues
__label__negative	The translation headphones had a connection failure, they did not allow me to understand the meaning of the words
__label__negative	The truth is they were engaged in combat and couldn’t do anything about it
__label__neutral	All the participants should be provided with good equipment.
__label__negative	The meeting was very crowded, some people even had to stand.
__label__negative	 Some people say  the meeting was not useful because they heard already about the latter
__label__neutral	I recommend that the objectives of the meetings be defined based on the results of the metrics
__label__negative	I can see his lack of commitment to job
__label__positive	I think that we've exhausted the topic.
__label__positive	 According to me the talk was fierce
__label__positive	I love her punctuality
__label__positive	I was better today than it was during previous sessions.
__label__positive	She is a fierce fighter
__label__positive	Thanks for your time
__label__negative	I am not happy with this solution, even if this problem was solved perfectly, it doesn't really end ignorance.
__label__negative	In my opinion not everyone are involved enough during those sessions.
__label__neutral	I am not in a position to make that decision
__label__negative	It was too long.
__label__negative	No one answers my e-mail concerning our meetings.
__label__negative	I didn’t like your presentation.
__label__negative	Could someone fix the microphone?
__label__negative	60 minutes was way too much for this subject.
__label__negative	So me guys were listening but the rest was playing on their mobiles.
__label__negative	 the training was not credible
__label__neutral	On the next occasion the presentation should be less extensive and much clearer.
__label__neutral	I have the impression you wanted to say something different.
__label__neutral	For the next meeting, I recommend presenting the work program by the previously disseminated agenda and remembering the objectives of the meeting.
__label__positive	 In my view the commander is calm 
__label__positive	The objectives of the presentation were achieved, they are experts in the field.
__label__negative	I would never use such words as the presenter did.
__label__negative	I really have better things to do.
__label__neutral	Please have a bigger screen for presentations
__label__negative	How on earth are we to achieve anything if we waste our time like this?!?!
__label__neutral	I would make tests after those lectures.
__label__neutral	I would love to see a new face during those meetings.
__label__negative	The main presenter had a short time presentation
__label__negative	It was too cold as always.
__label__positive	 the problem was interesting
__label__negative	The speaker was a noisy guy.
__label__positive	Congratulations, your talk was really inspiring!
__label__neutral	Somebody who is not interested should have the right not to participate.
__label__negative	If everyone did their job it would work.
__label__positive	In this meeting I noticed that there is an increase in knowledge and development of social skills over the participants.
__label__negative	Every time those meetings start at different time and end at different than it was written in a schedule.
__label__neutral	I hope for the next meeting let the participants give their opinions
__label__negative	I don't like you to talk like that.
__label__positive	 From my perspective the main idea is working
__label__positive	The presenter had the ability to persuade the public.
__label__negative	A bit hesitating
__label__positive	 In my opinion the commander is good
__label__neutral	Maybe you’re right, but the more we spend on maintenance the less we spend on innovation.
__label__positive	You managed to engage the audience.
__label__positive	What a wonderful story.
__label__positive	The commander knows how to handle depressing news
__label__negative	There is no internet connection for assistants
__label__neutral	There are tools that allow you to discuss many issues in an orderly manner and without the need to see yourself in person.
__label__positive	I’m glad the command is paying attention.
__label__neutral	Wider room for us all.
__label__positive	I feel the training was great
__label__negative	Women and men should not practice in the same group.
__label__neutral	They were talking of the type of topics they are afraid will break
__label__negative	The speaker was boring.
__label__negative	Nobody fixed the window since last week.
__label__neutral	Meeting earlier would be better.
__label__negative	Instead I listened to his harangue about the difficulties they encountered
__label__neutral	Perhaps we could bring guests for the next meeting?
__label__negative	The meeting room had few chairs for so many attendees
__label__negative	I don't suppose that anything would change after our discussion.
__label__negative	I hoped to get some more details, e-mail address or anything, from the speaker.
__label__positive	It was a pleasure to take part in such event.
__label__positive	It sounds like a real adventure!
__label__negative	Many ideas for so little time
__label__positive	 I believe the plan is not negative
__label__neutral	 Could you post a detailed interpretation of that law?
__label__negative	That was a mistake in the performance of his duty.
__label__negative	Please do not look at the cell phone while others speak.
__label__positive	Everything was on time.
__label__negative	Paying so much attention to occasional issues hinders our overall perception.
__label__neutral	I think that the microphone should be given to those who have something interesting to say.
__label__positive	It's wonderful how they shine!
__label__positive	Very interesting.
__label__negative	It was a total disaster.
__label__negative	It would cost a million dollars and not even be as good as a our own product
__label__positive	That afternoon Christopher had a wonderful story to tell.
__label__positive	The topics are very relevant to the problem in question.
__label__negative	My daily duties would become much more tiring after this change.
__label__negative	This meeting without access to WIFI was a mistake.
__label__neutral	I understand that there are only 15 minutes left before this meeting ends
__label__neutral	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should be given some materials from it.
__label__negative	We should have some new equipment to practice.
__label__neutral	You are a bit nervous, try to calm down, remember you are speaking to your friends
__label__negative	Breaks are to often.
__label__negative	The room was overcrowded.
__label__positive	Susana earned extra time at the meeting to get 5 questions right.
__label__neutral	Please leave something to take notes on
__label__positive	 From my view point the plan was helpful
__label__negative	It is really hard to focus with such noise outside the room.
__label__positive	Everyone was enjoying 
__label__positive	I anticipated the delight of talking to my general 
__label__positive	Four letters mentioned Rev. Martin and the wonderful work he and Annie were doing with 'the poor mistaken souls.'
__label__positive	Excellent graphics and statistical analysis.
__label__neutral	It’s essential we are prepared.
__label__neutral	Many of the issues discussed at the meeting could be resolved with a simple email.
__label__negative	I would never use such words as the guy did.
__label__positive	He was such a wonderful person in so many ways.
__label__negative	I find those subjects not practical.
__label__negative	Not all attendees arrived on time
__label__neutral	During the whole session he organized and directed the opposition in their attacks on the officials.
__label__negative	One of the guys stood up and started shouting and nobody cared.
__label__positive	Everyone should see the video that was played during the meeting
__label__neutral	Can we deliver a copy to each team member?
__label__positive	Those meetings give me hope for a change,
__label__neutral	Are you convinced you’re right?
__label__neutral	I hope that sb would organize some sort of entertainment,
__label__positive	Many thanks for an interesting meeting.
__label__negative	I'm still not on the mailing list.
__label__positive	The new guy showed punctuality  
__label__neutral	I think that it would be enough to meet once a month.
__label__neutral	I think that it would be better to meet more often and make the meetings shorter.
__label__positive	One cause for the excellence of her letters is the great number of them.
__label__positive	 the talk was charismatic
__label__neutral	I think that we need some more fire training.
__label__negative	Unfortunately the speaker did not have time to close the idea
__label__negative	The speakers were broke.
__label__positive	I hope I would be invited again.
__label__positive	I love the man, he has such a sense of humor.
__label__negative	I didn’t get the message about the meeting.
__label__positive	 According to me the major was good
__label__neutral	The soldiers should follow procedures
__label__neutral	I hope it would be improved.
__label__neutral	The presentation was accompanied by a kind of mathematical performance
__label__negative	I would never excuse such behavior.
__label__neutral	Those windows without curtains make it impossible to see anything on the screen.
__label__neutral	We should have a right to vote.
__label__neutral	My colleagues would prefer you talk a little slower.
__label__negative	Chairs are not comfortable at all.
__label__neutral	The newest data shows something different from what you were saying.
__label__negative	I think the commander was depressing
__label__positive	Excellent work in the given time span.
__label__negative	I’m not sure why but I feel this is wrong.
__label__positive	Focusing on what is going well can help you discover ways to solve other situations
__label__positive	Thanks meeting was very polite
__label__negative	The presentation on the computer was quite dense
__label__negative	Unfortunately, this session was unsuccessful.
__label__negative	I was on time and there was nobody in the room.
__label__positive	It was a pleasure to listen to your speech!
__label__negative	We don't need so many breaks.
__label__negative	I couldn’t read your tiny letters in the presentation.
__label__neutral	The entire session lasted barely ten minutes.
__label__positive	It's hard to think of any things that the organizers can change.
__label__neutral	How can this be achieved in the classroom?
__label__neutral	Last night we ran a session on the general email texted us about.
__label__negative	Some of us have more important things to do, than to sit and stare on one picture for an hour.
__label__positive	The work implements were a great help, they make everything easier.
__label__positive	 The plan is very well prepared
__label__neutral	We were intrigued. 
__label__negative	The remote control to the air conditioner is still missing.
__label__neutral	If I were you I would let them ask questions any time.
__label__negative	You were late!
__label__neutral	Can I see a written copy of the regulations that describe the procedure?
__label__negative	All the cables lying around the room are dangerous.
__label__neutral	You should be delighted to hear her opinion
__label__negative	It was such a mess...some of us started even playing cards.
__label__positive	Well done.
__label__neutral	I was surprised.
__label__positive	I love it that you've added the e-mail reminder.
__label__positive	I really appreciate your help.
__label__neutral	True, if we are to win this, we should start working right now.
__label__negative	The speaker sounded like he had no idea about the case.
__label__positive	I hope the commander can select the most suitable people to lead these meetings.
__label__neutral	The reasone for MTO to express such opinion was obvious.
__label__negative	From my personal experience it seems rather the opposite.
__label__positive	 Generally it is thought that the major is OK.
__label__positive	Congratulations.
__label__neutral	Can the presenter do it?
__label__negative	Calling too many meetings decreases credibility in the boss
__label__negative	This is a cyclic meeting and I would expect fresh updates every time and what do I get?
__label__negative	I was hoping to hear more about this idea.
__label__negative	Pure histrionics.
__label__neutral	What do you say if we have rehearsal in that room by the headquarters building?
__label__neutral	I think we should discuss urgent things.
__label__neutral	 From my perspective the talk was not awful
__label__negative	The pens did not have enough ink
__label__negative	I would tell this whole story in entirely different way.
__label__neutral	For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed.
__label__negative	They should not eat anything when presenting.
__label__negative	At the time of that meeting it didn’t produce an effect upon me
__label__negative	No words to describe my disapproval to what I saw.
__label__negative	She showed lack of commitment  
__label__negative	It was quite hot in the meeting room
__label__neutral	I’m not sure if this is a right way.
__label__negative	You were very late.
__label__neutral	I understand that this is the way you do things. 
__label__positive	A solemn meeting 
__label__neutral	My impression was that you didn’t want to tell us the whole story.
__label__neutral	Kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers
__label__negative	I believe that the meeting lasted 30 more minutes, I did not expect it
__label__positive	She is very attentive to detail
__label__positive	It is a great experience
__label__negative	Every single part started late than it was scheduled.
__label__neutral	Never experienced such thing.
__label__negative	I hate not having impact on what we discuss.
__label__negative	The presenter repeated the same thing he said during the last meetings
__label__positive	In my opinion you are right.
__label__positive	I don't feel like we've solved anything.
__label__positive	Now this is what I call a speech!
__label__neutral	It would be splendid to have that report emailed to everyone
__label__negative	It was so stuffy in the conference room that I couldn’t focus at all!
__label__negative	I think that listening to everyone’s complains for so many hour is a waste of time.
__label__positive	A young and innovative thinking according to the trend of your market.
__label__positive	After this meeting everyone had good mood!
__label__negative	Keep things simple.
__label__positive	Finally when the speaker was changed it started to be interesting.
__label__positive	An excellent idea that the people involved are summoned in advance and have sufficient information on the topics to treat
__label__negative	Please avoid parallel conversations.
__label__negative	 I’m of the opinion that the lecture is boring
__label__negative	In another room it was extremely noisy and nobody reacted.
__label__negative	The presenter deviated from the main topic
__label__negative	I didn't hear most important things.
__label__neutral	I’d pay more attention to details.
__label__neutral	Hopefully you can create something like a roadmap that ensures that what you have worked at the meeting will be useful and certainly productive
__label__negative	There's no time for such things.
__label__neyutral	The way of presenting the topic was surprising.
__label__neutral	I would prefer to hear few words of explanation before presentation of the problem.
__label__neutral	They should know better how to react in such situations in future.
__label__positive	All the staff did their job.
__label__negative	Why don’t you do some deeper research in the topic?
__label__negative	we do not agree with that recommendation
__label__neutral	Was this really about operations?
__label__neutral	It should include ending all non-infectious diseases as well.
__label__negative	I totally disagree.
__label__neutral	Next time, please start earlier
__label__positive	I appreciate you taking the time from your busy schedule to talk to me.
__label__neutral	I don’t know if the topic was good or bad as for now.
__label__neutral	My delight in them is as varied as my moods.
__label__neutral	Maybe suggest us to take notes next time?
__label__negative	The speaker got me really bored.
__label__positive	The meeting leader can continue to improve aspects of the meeting by concluding at the end of each meeting.
__label__negative	He did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave.
__label__negative	We got into the room and sit down for a few minutes in silence.
__label__neutral	I think that we should get access to the address book with contacts to other participants.
