__label__subject	The  reward, when it was available, certainly presented a temptation.

__label__time	The exhibitor allowed to advance the topic clearly and with good timing, without losing the main rithm of each subject
__label__technical	The lights are too bright.
__label__performance_assessment	I liked the story about general McKenzee
__label__performance_assessment	She showed lack of commitment  
__label__time	It was too short.

__label__recommendations	If I were you, I would do more slides with better figures
__label__recommendations	I would plan those meetings more in advance.
__label__recommendations	May I suggest that we postpone discussing this until the next meeting?

__label__performance_assessment	The idea of meetings is good.
__label__performance_assessment	She helps without begin asked
__label__recommendations	I think that it would be useful to make a mailing list.
__label__performance_assessment	Your description of the problem was thorough.
__label__subject	She was wired with a different kind of energy after the sparring session
__label__performance_assessment	The commander knows how to handle depressing news
__label__subject	And to this day, millions of people remember and honor the name of Gautama, as that of the great lover of men.
__label__performance_assessment	This wasn’t great but wasn’t bad either.
__label__subject	You divided the problem in 4 groups, but I think 6 would do better.
__label__performance_assessment	I’m glad the command is paying attention.

__label__technical	Chairs are not comfortable at all.
__label__technical	The presentation on the computer was quite dense
__label__subject	 the problem was interesting
__label__subject	Writing an act helps to remember.
__label__subject	I think that we've run out with the subjects.
__label__time	Every time those meetings start at different time and end at different than it was written in a schedule.
__label__recommendations	We need more fun.
__label__performance_assessment	The general showed a negative disposition  
__label__time	The new guy showed punctuality  
__label__technical	The technical services must meet the particular needs of the participants
__label__performance_assessment	Those attending these meetings see them as trivial and unimportant events.
__label__subject	Usually there is not enough men for the job.
__label__time	I was a little late and I wasn't allowed to join the meeting.

__label__subject	One cause for the excellence of her letters is the great number of them.

__label__subject	Today's topic is better than that of the previous meeting
__label__performance_assessment	I will not attend such meetings in the future.

__label__technical	The room was overcrowded.
__label__technical	The remote control to the air conditioner is still missing.

__label__technical	It's easier to spend all those hours in the room after the renovation.
__label__performance_assessment	I understand that this is the way you do things. 
__label__performance_assessment	I would love to listen to the same prelection again.
__label__performance_assessment	He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum

__label__performance_assessment	I had a wonderful time at the meeting
__label__subject	The way of presenting the topic was surprising.
__label__performance_assessment	Sorry, but you really could do better :(
__label__technical	The meeting room had few chairs for so many attendees
__label__recommendations	Good conclusions are always important
__label__subject	Finally, everything has come together and we are ready to open the doors to the public.
__label__performance_assessment	We all started arguing and nobody reacted and took care of the situation.
__label__performance_assessment	 I’m of the opinion that the lecture is boring
__label__technical	Finally somebody took care of all the technical problems.
__label__subject	I liked the topic.
__label__subject	 From my perspective the main idea is working

__label__performance_assessment	I had problems focusing my attention.
__label__performance_assessment	I have nothing to complain about.

__label__performance_assessment	Too many not answered questions.
__label__recommendations	I see a strong need to make some new rules during our sessions.

__label__performance_assessment	This presenter knows how to make a good meeting.
__label__technical	It was so stuffy in the conference room that I couldn’t focus at all!
__label__performance_assessment	 I’m of the opinion that the talk was not boring
__label__time	I understand that there are only 15 minutes left before this meeting ends
__label__technical	The place was inappropriate.
__label__performance_assessment	 Some people say that the meeting wasn’t boring
__label__performance_assessment	A very nice presentation.
__label__subject	The presenter repeated the same thing he said during the last meetings
__label__subject	I thought that we would discuss this topic and vote, but it didn't happen.
__label__recommendations	Women and men should not practice in the same group.
__label__recommendations	I recommend having a better dress by the exhibitors.
__label__recommendations	In meetings, delays should not be allowed unless they are for a greater cause.
__label__recommendations	Maybe shorter presentations would be better.
__label__performance_assessment	The commander showed focus on the subject 
__label__recommendations	Hopefully you can create something like a roadmap that ensures that what you have worked at the meeting will be useful and certainly productive

__label__subject	I didn’t like the topic.
__label__time	Everything was on time.
__label__recommendations	You should be delighted to hear her opinion
__label__recommendations	Maybe it's not so hard to organize some catering.
__label__subject	 Generally it is thought that the plan was absurd
__label__time	We got into the room and sit down for a few minutes in silence.
__label__subject	The chain of command was not working
__label__recommendations	If I were you I would let them ask questions any time.
__label__performance_assessment	Great job.
__label__recommendations	Start at the announced time (at most, save 15 minutes of courtesy if many people are missing)
__label__performance_assessment	You've taken a great deal off my shoulders, and I appreciate it.
__label__performance_assessment	Hopefully, this was his one and only session with drinking too much.
__label__subject	The didactic content made everything much easier, it was amazing
__label__recommendations	Before the meeting, the presenter should check that his objectives are clear and justify his need
__label__performance_assessment	Let's talk about what is working.
__label__time	Punctuality of the members is fundamental
__label__recommendations	Don’t chat during the presentations
__label__time	Participants had time to ask questions and discuss them.
