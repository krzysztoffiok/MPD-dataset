__label__neutral	True, if we are to win this, we should start working right now.
__label__negative	The computer is very slow
__label__neutral	I think that we need some more fire training.
__label__neutral	I have the impression you wanted to say something different.
__label__positive	 the talk was charismatic
__label__neutral	I don’t know if the topic was good or bad as for now.
__label__positive	The  reward, when it was available, certainly presented a temptation.
__label__negative	Our main case wasn't discussed at all.
__label__neutral	We should work more on this.
__label__positive	The exhibitor allowed to advance the topic clearly and with good timing, without losing the main rithm of each subject
__label__negative	I couldn't focus on the case.
__label__positive	Congratulations.
__label__neutral	If I were you, I would do more slides with better figures
__label__neutral	Of course, she knew Alex well enough now to know he didn't like people to hand out information about him.
__label__negative	Too short breaks.
__label__positive	I liked the way you talk.
__label__negative	Many of the objectives defined at the beginning of the meeting were not met
__label__negative	Please do not look at the cell phone while others speak.
__label__negative	Those chairs and tables are old and uncomfortable.
__label__positive	I didn't realize that our meetings can solve so many problems.
__label__positive	Very interesting.
__label__negative	Do you think it was nice to listen to all this negative stuff?
__label__positive	The idea of meetings is good.
__label__positive	Well organized.
__label__negative	I can imagine more useful skills that we can learn.
__label__negative	I didn't have a place to sit.
__label__positive	It was the highest time to discuss this topic.
__label__negative	The speaker was a noisy guy.
__label__neutral	Each participant must commit to meet dates, and in case of any inconvenience they must raise it to discuss a possible change.
__label__neutral	I can show you where that information stands out in the report and in the progress notes.
__label__negative	These have been long and boring meetings
__label__positive	100% performance.
__label__neutral	She was wired with a different kind of energy after the sparring session
__label__positive	Working as a team is the key for every company to develop, grow and not be affected by the high competition that exists today
__label__neutral	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should have the right to vote.
__label__neutral	 I guess frequent talking with people about such issues is working
__label__neutral	Last night we ran a session on the general email texted us about.
__label__negative	It was such a mess...some of us started even playing cards.
__label__neutral	For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed.
__label__neutral	I always have a problem with preparing my speech.
__label__positive	Susana earned extra time at the meeting to get 5 questions right.
__label__negative	There are members who answer emails, consult social networks or other tasks not related to the theme of the meeting
__label__negative	People asked unnecessary questions.
__label__positive	I was better today than it was during previous sessions.
__label__neutral	I think we should find a new way of discussing our stuff.
__label__negative	Too long breaks.
__label__negative	Instead of getting angry, be practical.
__label__neutral	During the whole session he organized and directed the opposition in their attacks on the officials.
__label__positive	We were all well informed for the first time.
__label__positive	The topics are very relevant to the problem in question.
__label__neutral	I recommend encouraging debate for upcoming meetings
__label__negative	A bit hesitating
__label__positive	Thank you very much for meeting with me yesterday regarding my current project.
__label__negative	I liked the topic but the presenting guy didn't manage to make me interested in listening.
__label__positive	She is very attentive to detail
__label__negative	No place to charge our laptops!
__label__positive	That afternoon Christopher had a wonderful story to tell.
__label__negative	Do you think you’ll convince people simply by repeating your version?
__label__positive	I really appreciated that you’ve finished on time.
__label__negative	She had a suspicious behavior
__label__positive	His delight is to know the law and show it to everyone
__label__negative	Can anybody fix those chairs?
__label__negative	Do we have some technical staff to help in emergencies at all?
__label__positive	Suddenly there was a great news
__label__neutral	Okay, you think that won't work for Olivia. 
__label__positive	 the problem was interesting
__label__positive	Writing an act helps to remember.
__label__positive	The attendees had the relevant data for the meeting.
__label__negative	The general showed a negative disposition  
__label__positive	The new guy showed punctuality  
__label__negative	The technical services must meet the particular needs of the participants
__label__neutral	Usually there is not enough men for the job.
__label__neutral	Are you sure no one would follow?
__label__positive	I appreciate you started on time.
__label__positive	A leader is someone who knows the way, walks the way and shows the way. 
__label__neutral	Perhaps we could ask the general if he has permission to leave the base?
__label__negative	 In my eyes the commander is not working
__label__negative	He is always late.
__label__neutral	You should let us know the purpose and reason for the meeting before it takes place
__label__negative	 From my perspective the proposed changes to WTO are absurd
__label__neutral	There should be a leader who has enough sensitivity to identify how he can empower each component of his team.
__label__negative	Prevent the commitments made at the meeting from being forgotten.
__label__negative	Unfortunately the speaker did not have time to close the idea
__label__positive	I think that it was enough time for everything.
__label__positive	A look of satisfaction spread over the face of the creature before her.
__label__negative	Too many abbreviations.
__label__positive	A pity not everyone knows how to be as punctual as you are!
__label__negative	I find those subjects not practical.
__label__neutral	We can divide into groups by our own.
__label__negative	A little advice: keep it short!
__label__positive	The internet connection area was quite fast at the meeting place.
__label__positive	it's a long conversation about what's going wrong
__label__neutral	I would consider it useful to be introduced before such meetings.
__label__neutral	It is also important to talk about deadlines, actions or responsible for future tasks
__label__negative	 I’m of the opinion that the review was poor
__label__positive	You are a valuable member of our team, and I really appreciate your contributions!
__label__neutral	We all hope that the quality of information improves
__label__positive	Without those meetings it would be harder to survive this time.
__label__negative	20 minutes late is too late.
__label__negative	I was hoping to hear more about this idea.
__label__negative	I see a need of being informed about the subject of the meeting earlier.
__label__negative	 Some people say that the review process does not work
__label__neutral	I recommend you say what the agenda will be at the beginning of the meeting
__label__neutral	I will make sure to send you a follow-up when this project is completed.
__label__positive	He showed knowledge  
__label__positive	The data regarding Afganistan was really up to date.
__label__negative	It was too long.
__label__positive	If all meetings were like this, I’d love to come more often.
__label__neutral	They should know better how to react in such situations in future.
__label__neutral	On one hand I understand your point, on the other hand I disagree
__label__negative	The remote control to the air conditioner is still missing.
__label__negative	Why don’t you do some deeper research in the topic?
__label__neutral	Everyone should obey the rules of our sessions.
__label__positive	I’m of the opinion that the training was necessary and should be continued
__label__positive	I anticipated the delight of talking to my general 
__label__negative	We all started arguing and nobody reacted and took care of the situation.
__label__negative	Can anyone put the soup in the bathroom?
__label__neutral	On the contrary, I think our mission is to protect them.
__label__negative	I think the commander was depressing
__label__positive	Finally somebody took care of all the technical problems.
__label__neutral	I hope we have more participation in choosing the topic of the next meeting
__label__negative	I hate not having impact on what we discuss.
__label__negative	 Some people say  the speaker is not credible
__label__positive	You managed to engage the audience.
__label__negative	 the training was not credible
__label__neutral	The enumeration of the chairs for each assistant would be perfect, there would be more order.
__label__neutral	I recall seeing this somewhere already.
__label__neutral	Somebody who is not interested should have the right not to participate.
__label__neutral	Was the meeting supposed to begin at 12?
__label__negative	You were very late.
__label__positive	You have really improved since our last meeting.
__label__positive	The speech was charismatic and inspired many listeners
__label__positive	After those meetings I always have so many new ideas.
__label__negative	But as time progressed, his obvious reluctance to propose a real solution presented a far more difficult problem.
__label__neutral	It would be splendid to have that report emailed to everyone
__label__positive	I appreciated all the examples
__label__negative	I don't believe that it will change anything.
__label__neutral	He needs to take out that phrase
__label__neutral	I understand that there are only 15 minutes left before this meeting ends
__label__neutral	She should discuss all this with Alex.
__label__neutral	Please have a bigger screen for presentations
__label__negative	Some headphones did not work.
__label__neutral	I think that changing the speaker would help.
__label__negative	Reading and answering emails breaks the work dynamics a lot
__label__negative	If the microphone is faulty it’s better not to use it….
__label__negative	All these are absurd rules
__label__positive	I think the plan is credible
__label__neutral	We should think about some new quest, that e can invite to our discussion.
__label__neutral	Maybe we could invite some quests?
__label__positive	Challenging.
__label__positive	He is an expert
__label__negative	I can see his lack of commitment to job
__label__negative	Paying so much attention to occasional issues hinders our overall perception.
__label__negative	 Some people say  the meeting was not useful because they heard already about the latter
__label__neutral	I recommend having a better dress by the exhibitors.
__label__negative	60 minutes was way too much for this subject.
__label__positive	In this meeting I noticed that there is an increase in knowledge and development of social skills over the participants.
__label__neutral	His delight in plans frequently appears in memorandums written to his soldiers during summer
__label__positive	 The talk was amazing
__label__negative	 The training was boring
__label__positive	Suddenly there was a great topic
__label__neutral	I’m not sure if going into such detail is useful.
__label__negative	I didn’t like the topic.
__label__negative	This was a very boring meeting.
__label__neutral	You better don’t talk so much or you will get boring
__label__negative	That was a mistake in the performance of his duty.
__label__neutral	Maybe it's not so hard to organize some catering.
__label__positive	I love it that you've added the e-mail reminder.
__label__neutral	I would prefer to hear few words of explanation before presentation of the problem.
__label__negative	One of the guys stood up and started shouting and nobody cared.
__label__neutral	If I were you I would let them ask questions any time.
__label__negative	The meeting took a long time.
__label__positive	I really liked your presentation.
__label__negative	I didn't like those yokes that the speaker used during presentation.
__label__neutral	I remember similar topics covered in speeches during my initial training.
__label__neutral	I was surprised.
__label__negative	With all due respect, this was horrible.
__label__neutral	Before the meeting, the presenter should check that his objectives are clear and justify his need
__label__neutral	I think the real problem is elsewhere.
__label__negative	No one has such old machines to practice.
