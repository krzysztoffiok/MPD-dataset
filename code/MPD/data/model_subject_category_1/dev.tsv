__label__time	I came in a few minutes after the meeting should have started, but there was no one in the room
__label__technical	Chairs are not comfortable at all.
__label__subject	Writing an act helps to remember.
__label__time	Every time those meetings start at different time and end at different than it was written in a schedule.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't like that way of presentation.
__label__technical	The technical services must meet the particular needs of the participants

__label__subject	Can't wee finally talk about something important in our work?
__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to take part in such event.

__label__performance_assessment	You get to meet all kinds of interesting people in that meeting
__label__subject	Today's topic is better than that of the previous meeting
__label__recommendations	You should replay that part and see it for yourself
__label__technical	The pens did not have enough ink

__label__subject	Can the presenter do it?
__label__technical	It's easier to spend all those hours in the room after the renovation.
__label__performance_assessment	I understand that this is the way you do things. 
__label__performance_assessment	 Generally it is thought that the topic is not interesting
__label__performance_assessment	For the most part, though, her presentation was interesting 
__label__performance_assessment	I would tell this whole story in entirely different way.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker sounded like he had no idea about the case.
__label__time	When was the course suppose to end?

__label__recommendations	Someone should do better job when cleaning the meeting room!
__label__performance_assessment	I liked more the second part of the meeting.
__label__time	They commenced another session without even bothering to give people a 3 minute break.
__label__subject	Is Mr. Smith the one with that authority? 
__label__performance_assessment	After this meeting everyone had good mood!
__label__technical	Maybe if we were given sth to eat it would be easier.

__label__time	60 minutes was way too much for this subject.

__label__subject	In that way, we would never get the subject exhausted!
__label__recommendations	Hopefully you can create something like a roadmap that ensures that what you have worked at the meeting will be useful and certainly productive
__label__recommendations	I suggest changing the speaker.
__label__recommendations	What if next time we could just invite the important people?
__label__performance_assessment	Those meetings give me hope for a change,
__label__recommendations	Maybe we should be given some materials before meetings?
__label__recommendations	I’m not sure if going into such detail is useful.
__label__performance_assessment	"Thank you for preparing a ""report"" with the conclusions and agreements reached."
__label__recommendations	Somebody should lock the door after the beginning.
__label__performance_assessment	I would never excuse such behavior.
__label__recommendations	You should be delighted to hear her opinion
__label__recommendations	Maybe it's not so hard to organize some catering.
__label__technical	I love it that you've added the e-mail reminder.
__label__performance_assessment	I really liked your presentation.
__label__technical	The air conditioner didn't work.
__label__subject	The story you told us is a good example.
__label__performance_assessment	With all due respect, this was horrible.
__label__recommendations	The meeting leader can continue to improve aspects of the meeting by concluding at the end of each meeting.
__label__technical	The new pointers were really helpful during the presentation.
__label__performance_assessment	I've never seen such a great speaker.
__label__subject	The whole idea makes me feel sick!
__label__performance_assessment	Let's talk about what is working.
