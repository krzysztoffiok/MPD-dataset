__label__neutral	Try talking to the people seating in front of you next time, not to the room.
__label__negative	It was too short.
__label__neutral	Why should that cause the masses to riot?
__label__positive	Congratulations.
__label__positive	I love our new phantoms.

__label__neutral	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should have the right to vote.
__label__positive	The commander knows how to handle depressing news
__label__neutral	 I guess frequent talking with people about such issues is working
__label__negative	It was such a mess...some of us started even playing cards.
__label__neutral	For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed.
__label__neutral	I always have a problem with preparing my speech.
__label__positive	I’m glad the command is paying attention.

__label__positive	Good as always.
__label__positive	When the opportunity presented itself, she grabbed it and make us listen to her story.
__label__negative	Lack of toilet paper.
__label__negative	Waste of money and time.
__label__negative	Bad idea.
__label__negative	I came in a few minutes after the meeting should have started, but there was no one in the room
__label__negative	Chairs are not comfortable at all.
__label__positive	Writing an act helps to remember.
__label__negative	Every time those meetings start at different time and end at different than it was written in a schedule.
__label__negative	I don't like that way of presentation.
__label__negative	The technical services must meet the particular needs of the participants
__label__neutral	We need charismatic leaders in such situations
__label__neutral	Perhaps people would like to read those instructions
__label__neutral	You should do something about the problem.
__label__neutral	We should be awarded for active participation.
__label__positive	The meetings are important but have been discredited by the lack of specificity and organization around them

__label__neutral	For next time go to the point and do not get off the subject.
__label__negative	The presenter deviated from the main topic
__label__neutral	What do you say if I help you next time?

__label__positive	One cause for the excellence of her letters is the great number of them.
__label__positive	The internet connection area was quite fast at the meeting place.
__label__positive	it's a long conversation about what's going wrong

__label__positive	Government is a great achievement of civilization.
__label__neutral	We all hope that the quality of information improves
__label__neutral	We need someone to write down all the suggestions raised durin the session.
__label__negative	20 minutes late is too late.
__label__neutral	Some of the participants should get a reprimand.
__label__negative	I don’t think repeating the same story all over again will make it true.
__label__negative	I see a need of being informed about the subject of the meeting earlier.
__label__negative	Productivity was affected by external factors such as lack of good sound
__label__negative	You were late!
__label__negative	Do we have to use this broken chairs because someone is lazy or we lack funds?
__label__positive	I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your help with the project.
__label__negative	Can't wee finally talk about something important in our work?
__label__positive	It was a pleasure to take part in such event.
__label__neutral	My colleagues would prefer you talk a little slower.
__label__neutral	I think that wee need three more meetings on the same topic, because it was not enough time to talk everything thru.
__label__positive	You get to meet all kinds of interesting people in that meeting
__label__positive	Today's topic is better than that of the previous meeting
__label__neutral	You should replay that part and see it for yourself
__label__negative	The pens did not have enough ink
__label__negative	The remote control to the air conditioner is still missing.
__label__positive	In this meeting, I learned more than in the previous 10
__label__neutral	Please send a list of topics to cover 24 hours in advance.
__label__neutral	Can the presenter do it?
__label__positive	It's easier to spend all those hours in the room after the renovation.
__label__neutral	I understand that this is the way you do things. 
__label__neutral	 Generally it is thought that the topic is not interesting
__label__positive	For the most part, though, her presentation was interesting 
__label__negative	I would tell this whole story in entirely different way.
__label__negative	The speaker sounded like he had no idea about the case.
__label__neutral	When was the course suppose to end?
__label__negative	The way that major was presenting guests was strongly inappropriate.
__label__positive	Finally, everything has come together and we are ready to open the doors to the public.

__label__negative	I think the commander was depressing
__label__positive	It is a great experience
__label__positive	 From my perspective the main idea is working
__label__negative	The practical part with exercises was too short.
__label__negative	Someone should do better job when cleaning the meeting room!
__label__neutral	I liked more the second part of the meeting.
__label__negative	They commenced another session without even bothering to give people a 3 minute break.
__label__neutral	Is Mr. Smith the one with that authority? 
__label__positive	After this meeting everyone had good mood!
__label__negative	Maybe if we were given sth to eat it would be easier.
__label__negative	The meeting was extended leaving us with little time for the most important part
__label__positive	The presenter achieved each and every one of his goals
__label__positive	Excellent meeting a time well spent
__label__positive	Very nice meeting!

__label__negative	I don't like discussing the same thing all the time.
__label__neutral	I understand that there are only 15 minutes left before this meeting ends
__label__positive	Thank you for offering to jointly coordinate the Hospitality Committee.
__label__neutral	I think that changing the speaker would help.
__label__positive	 I liked how the themes were synthesized.
__label__negative	Breaks are to often.
__label__negative	You ought to be more polite.
__label__negative	Unfortunately, this session was unsuccessful.
__label__positive	He is an expert
__label__positive	I would contend that the size of this problem is substantially smaller than many people would guess.
__label__positive	I must say this was amazing!
__label__neutral	I recommend having a better dress by the exhibitors.
__label__neutral	Everyone should be involved.
__label__negative	60 minutes was way too much for this subject.
__label__negative	The sound was too loud.
__label__negative	In that way, we would never get the subject exhausted!
__label__neutral	Hopefully you can create something like a roadmap that ensures that what you have worked at the meeting will be useful and certainly productive
__label__negative	I suggest changing the speaker.
__label__neutral	What if next time we could just invite the important people?
__label__positive	Those meetings give me hope for a change,
__label__neutral	Maybe we should be given some materials before meetings?
__label__neutral	I’m not sure if going into such detail is useful.
__label__positive	"Thank you for preparing a ""report"" with the conclusions and agreements reached."
__label__neutral	Somebody should lock the door after the beginning.
__label__negative	I would never excuse such behavior.
__label__neutral	You should be delighted to hear her opinion
__label__neutral	Maybe it's not so hard to organize some catering.
__label__positive	I love it that you've added the e-mail reminder.
__label__positive	I really liked your presentation.
__label__negative	The air conditioner didn't work.
__label__positive	The story you told us is a good example.
__label__negative	With all due respect, this was horrible.
__label__positive	The meeting leader can continue to improve aspects of the meeting by concluding at the end of each meeting.
__label__positive	The new pointers were really helpful during the presentation.
__label__positive	I've never seen such a great speaker.
__label__negative	The whole idea makes me feel sick!
__label__positive	Let's talk about what is working.
