__label__neutral	Maybe we should be given some materials before meetings?
__label__neutral	We should be given a tablet or laptop during those sessions.
__label__neutral	Although you have all been to the same meeting, it is possible that there may be misunderstandings, it is important to make clear the conclusions and next steps
