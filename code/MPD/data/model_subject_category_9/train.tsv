__label__recommendations	That group should drop out 
__label__recommendations	May I suggest to have hangouts and coffee?
__label__subject	 Some people say that the review process does not work
__label__performance_assessment	 the training was not credible
__label__performance_assessment	I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your help with the project.
__label__subject	A very good topic.
__label__performance_assessment	"A new meeting without results and focused on ""technical aspects""."
__label__technical	No one has such old machines to practice.
__label__recommendations	Good conclusions are always important
__label__recommendations	We all hope that the quality of information improves
__label__subject	 I hold the view that the remarks presented during the speech were unfortunate
__label__performance_assessment	I'm really impressed.
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't fall asleep but I was close to it.
__label__recommendations	Next time please have better reasons
__label__recommendations	I would love to see a new face during those meetings.
__label__performance_assessment	We were intrigued. 
__label__performance_assessment	Do you think it was nice to listen to all this negative stuff?
__label__subject	Do you think you’ll convince people simply by repeating your version?
__label__technical	Could someone fix the microphone?
__label__performance_assessment	 I’m of the opinion that the meeting was not interesting
__label__subject	I am not happy with this solution, even if this problem was solved perfectly, it doesn't really end ignorance.
__label__performance_assessment	There was no harmony in this meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	I think he is an unfortunate person
__label__performance_assessment	Hopefully, this was his one and only session with drinking too much.
__label__recommendations	I think that we need some more fire training.
__label__recommendations	There should be no selective reduction.
__label__subject	Considering the problems they presented, she could hardly blame him for that.
__label__subject	I share your point of view.
__label__recommendations	The mentioned institutions should give more advice.
__label__time	60 minutes was way too much for this subject.
__label__recommendations	Maybe suggest us to take notes next time?
__label__performance_assessment	I wish I didn’t go to this meeting
__label__performance_assessment	Why did you rush with the presentation?
__label__performance_assessment	I feel the training was great
__label__technical	All the cables lying around the room are dangerous.
__label__recommendations	Why don’t you do some deeper research in the topic?
__label__time	It's a pity that there was no time for comments from the quests.
__label__performance_assessment	I understand that this is the way you do things. 
__label__time	Punctuality of the members is fundamental
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter did nothing as planned.
__label__time	I appreciate you started on time.
__label__performance_assessment	It is useful to have someone who has had experience with similar problems in previous projects to talk to.
__label__performance_assessment	In this meeting, I learned more than in the previous 10
__label__subject	I didn't learn anything new.
__label__recommendations	I think there are many things to change.
__label__subject	 I believe the plan is not negative
__label__performance_assessment	The atmosphere of the meeting was warm.
__label__subject	Thank you very much for meeting with me yesterday regarding my current project.
__label__subject	The proposed frequency is to high, it will cause trouble.
__label__performance_assessment	The guy that organized it should get fired at once!
__label__time	The main presenter had a short time presentation
__label__performance_assessment	So many hours without a break?
__label__technical	It is really hard to focus with such noise outside the room.
__label__recommendations	We should encourage more behavior like this.
__label__subject	There should be a leader who has enough sensitivity to identify how he can empower each component of his team.
__label__performance_assessment	She likes depressing stories
__label__performance_assessment	One of the guys stood up and started shouting and nobody cared.
__label__performance_assessment	The attention he garnered amazed him.
__label__time	A pity not everyone knows how to be as punctual as you are!
__label__performance_assessment	Your hesitation influenced the audience.
__label__technical	The remote control to the air conditioner is still missing.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker was great as always.
__label__time	I think that five minutes for every opinion is enough.
__label__recommendations	There should be a leader, someone who would give a right direction to all those discussions.
__label__recommendations	I would suggest thinking about better coffee during breaks.
__label__time	I was a little late and I wasn't allowed to join the meeting.
__label__recommendations	I would contend that the size of this problem is substantially smaller than many people would guess.
__label__performance_assessment	At the time of that meeting it didn’t produce an effect upon me
__label__performance_assessment	Thanks to that meetings I'm in better mood.
__label__time	Starting and finishing on time was appreciated.
__label__performance_assessment	Too many abbreviations.
__label__technical	Finally somebody fixed the air conditioning.
__label__technical	The microphone was not working well
__label__recommendations	Some of the participants should get a reprimand.
__label__subject	 I guess frequent talking with people about such issues is working
__label__performance_assessment	I think the commander was depressing
__label__subject	This, according to general Franco, would be inconvenient.
__label__performance_assessment	It is a great experience
__label__performance_assessment	Well organized.
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter did not review well the points that he was going to deal with
__label__recommendations	Could you please recommend how to solve this problem during your next speech?
__label__recommendations	I recommend that the objectives of the meetings be defined based on the results of the metrics
__label__subject	The presented idea may be eligible for the “idea of the month” award
__label__recommendations	He needs to take out that phrase
__label__performance_assessment	I don't know what to say.
__label__subject	In that way, we would never get the subject exhausted!
__label__subject	And to this day, millions of people remember and honor the name of Gautama, as that of the great lover of men.
__label__time	You started right on time which is appreciated.
__label__performance_assessment	Good job!
__label__performance_assessment	Im definitely not the only one who thinks  the speaker was not fierce
__label__technical	The air conditioner didn't work.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't like you to talk like that.
__label__subject	The problem is we talk to little about this.
__label__subject	 Generally it is thought that soldiers are nervous
__label__performance_assessment	Because the boredom of the lecture made me drowsy
__label__recommendations	We don't need so many breaks.
__label__subject	It was the highest time to discuss this topic.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker was a noisy guy.
__label__performance_assessment	I didn’t like your presentation.
__label__time	The meeting was extended leaving us with little time for the most important part
__label__performance_assessment	There's no time for such things.
__label__performance_assessment	I think that listening to everyone’s complains for so many hour is a waste of time.
__label__performance_assessment	After this meeting everyone had good mood!
__label__subject	In my opinion you are right.
__label__subject	AWS should not play any part in the decision making process.
__label__technical	This meeting without access to WIFI was a mistake.
__label__technical	I'm still not on the mailing list.
__label__performance_assessment	After those meetings I always have so many new ideas.
__label__performance_assessment	It was an interesting conversation
__label__performance_assessment	He is doing an interesting talk
__label__subject	Suddenly there was a great news
__label__performance_assessment	I wonder how long did you prepare for this presentation?
__label__subject	Today's topic is better than that of the previous meeting
__label__performance_assessment	 From my perspective the competition was excellent
__label__recommendations	we do not agree with that recommendation
__label__performance_assessment	She is very attentive to detail
__label__subject	It sounds like a real adventure!
__label__subject	On one hand I understand your point, on the other hand I disagree
__label__performance_assessment	 Some people say that the meeting wasn’t boring
__label__subject	One cause for the excellence of her letters is the great number of them.
__label__recommendations	It should be ready now, not in 2 months!
__label__time	I love her punctuality
__label__recommendations	You should do something about the problem.
__label__recommendations	What if next time we could just invite the important people?
__label__recommendations	Instead of getting angry, be practical.
__label__recommendations	For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed.
__label__recommendations	One of the participants must be publicly responsible for recording in writing what was agreed at the meeting.
__label__technical	No time to pee during breaks.
__label__time	For the next meeting we hope to start and end the meeting at the planned hours
__label__subject	Dean presented the facts unemotionally but as soon as he mentioned Scranton, the old man caught the coincidence and could hardly contain himself.
__label__recommendations	He should not listen to anyone who tried to persuade him to stay, he had his orders.
__label__recommendations	I hope someone is responsible for writing an email that recapitulates everything, orders ideas and prevents possible errors or confusion
__label__performance_assessment	 From my perspective the talk was not awful
__label__recommendations	The minutes should include the issues addressed in it, the pending tasks, who should perform them and for when.
__label__recommendations	We need more fun.
__label__performance_assessment	I think that the microphone should be given to those who have something interesting to say.
__label__performance_assessment	The idea of meetings is good.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker got me really bored.
__label__subject	If this is what the Navy thinks i’m terrified.
__label__recommendations	Please make things more readable on you slides next time!
__label__performance_assessment	Thanks for your time
__label__performance_assessment	From my experience, I know that half of the meetings are considered unproductive by their attendees.
__label__recommendations	I think that we should get access to the address book with contacts to other participants.
__label__time	It was too short.
__label__time	Unfortunately the speaker did not have time to close the idea
__label__time	In my opinion five minutes is too short.
__label__recommendations	For next time go to the point and do not get off the subject.
__label__recommendations	She should discuss all this with Alex.
__label__performance_assessment	It was boring.
__label__subject	A young and innovative thinking according to the trend of your market.
__label__performance_assessment	I think that sticking to the schedule is not so important as answering all the questions.
__label__performance_assessment	 It goes without saying that the training was working
__label__recommendations	We should have some impact on the results.
__label__recommendations	They should carry out more activities for public participation
__label__subject	It would be continual mistake to pursue this line
__label__subject	Reading and answering emails breaks the work dynamics a lot
__label__performance_assessment	I would never use such words as the guy did.
__label__recommendations	Wider room for us all.
__label__subject	Addresses were presented to him at Southampton, Birmingham and other towns
__label__performance_assessment	A solemn meeting 
__label__subject	It’s essential we are prepared.
__label__technical	Finally it wasn't so hot in the place.
__label__performance_assessment	An excellent idea that the people involved are summoned in advance and have sufficient information on the topics to treat
__label__performance_assessment	I couldn’t stop looking at the clock, I wanted to get out so quickly!
__label__performance_assessment	I don't find pleasure in wasting time.
__label__subject	How can we improve our execution?
__label__subject	The truth is they were engaged in combat and couldn’t do anything about it
__label__recommendations	I would change everything.
__label__recommendations	Please do not look at the cell phone while others speak.
__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to take part in such event.
__label__recommendations	I recommend having a better dress by the exhibitors.
__label__subject	Why should that cause the masses to riot?
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't realize that we are in such situation.
__label__performance_assessment	Not enough team working.
__label__performance_assessment	I was better today than it was during previous sessions.
__label__subject	The meeting was full of topics that were simply not interesting
__label__time	I was on time and there was nobody in the room.
__label__subject	There are members who answer emails, consult social networks or other tasks not related to the theme of the meeting
__label__technical	The presenter achieved each and every one of his goals
__label__performance_assessment	After those meetings I always have a headache.
__label__subject	What are the consequences of having such diversity in a work group?
__label__recommendations	Focusing on what is going well can help you discover ways to solve other situations
__label__performance_assessment	We all started arguing and nobody reacted and took care of the situation.
__label__performance_assessment	He is an interesting man
__label__subject	We should ask him what he meant
__label__performance_assessment	You get to meet all kinds of interesting people in that meeting
__label__recommendations	If you focus on the main subject, you’ll get more attention.
__label__subject	The topics don’t vary enough.
__label__time	He is always late.
__label__performance_assessment	Great figures and tables!
__label__subject	The  reward, when it was available, certainly presented a temptation.
__label__recommendations	I think that changing the speaker would help.
__label__recommendations	I hope that sb would organize some sort of entertainment,
__label__performance_assessment	I would never excuse such behavior.
__label__technical	The meeting was very crowded, some people even had to stand.
__label__subject	They admired the idea very much, for they had never seen anything like it.
__label__time	Timely starting your meetings would be much appreciated.
__label__performance_assessment	If all attendees are clear about the objectives and topics to be discussed, the meeting will be better
__label__subject	The presenter was not serious in the assessments he made
__label__performance_assessment	 From my perspective the commander not was good
__label__time	Every single part started late than it was scheduled.
__label__technical	The room was in a mass as always.
__label__performance_assessment	Amazing how easy it was for you to carry out an interesting meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	Sorry, but you really could do better :(
__label__performance_assessment	It is hard to expect anyone to keep focused after a whole hour of densely-packed presentation.
__label__subject	My impression was that you didn’t want to tell us the whole story.
__label__recommendations	I think we should find a new way of discussing our stuff.
__label__time	Many ideas for so little time
__label__subject	I don’t know if the topic was good or bad as for now.
__label__recommendations	Somebody should lock the door after the beginning.
__label__time	Was the meeting supposed to begin at 12?
__label__recommendations	We should think about some new topic, more up to date.
__label__technical	I couldn’t hear in the back of the room
__label__subject	It is important to understand more effectively the actions or circumstances that affect the work team.
__label__technical	The chairs are very uncomfortable.
__label__performance_assessment	One of the participants was drunk and nobody reacted to his behavior.
__label__performance_assessment	Too long breaks.
__label__subject	It was really upsetting to hear their story.
__label__performance_assessment	And again no results.
__label__performance_assessment	I finally understood what you mean in the very last minutes of your speech.
__label__subject	We need charismatic leaders in such situations
__label__subject	I don’t think we should change our organization units on these occasions.
__label__subject	The data regarding Afganistan was really up to date.
__label__technical	I hate practicing on that old equipment.
__label__performance_assessment	I must say this was amazing!
__label__subject	I didn't hear most important things.
__label__recommendations	I'll suggest more time for answering questions.
__label__time	When was the course suppose to end?
__label__time	20 minutes late is too late.
__label__subject	If we did what he proposed, we wouldn’t get far.
__label__technical	The new pointers were really helpful during the presentation.
__label__subject	 Some people say  the meeting was not useful because they heard already about the latter
__label__performance_assessment	I've never seen such a great speaker.
__label__performance_assessment	 The training was boring
__label__performance_assessment	Good as always.
__label__recommendations	You had better be prepared next time.
__label__recommendations	My colleagues would prefer you talk a little slower.
__label__recommendations	It’s better to use the microphone.
__label__subject	We can talk about how we want to divide things and coordinate with the chairs about dates.
__label__performance_assessment	The objectives of the presentation were achieved, they are experts in the field.
__label__performance_assessment	The presentation was accompanied by a kind of mathematical performance
__label__performance_assessment	This wasn’t great but wasn’t bad either.
__label__technical	There are not enough windows that we could open, it was hard to breathe.
__label__performance_assessment	She is a fierce fighter
__label__performance_assessment	Many thanks for an interesting meeting.
__label__recommendations	Perhaps people would like to read those instructions
__label__performance_assessment	Calling too many meetings decreases credibility in the boss
__label__recommendations	I think that it would be enough to meet once a month.
__label__technical	Some headphones did not work.
__label__recommendations	Please do your homework next time.
__label__performance_assessment	It's wonderful how they shine!
__label__subject	I would prefer to hear some new information, not things that we all already know.
__label__technical	I didn't hear most important things because of the microphone.
__label__performance_assessment	She showed lack of commitment  
__label__performance_assessment	 I liked how the themes were synthesized.
__label__subject	In the ancient world, man wanted guidance from the gods on what he should do.
__label__technical	The pens did not have enough ink
__label__recommendations	I think he can do a better job
__label__performance_assessment	Great job.
__label__recommendations	Someone should take care for sticking to the protocol.
__label__performance_assessment	I did not like his plan and they way he put things on display
__label__technical	Productivity was affected by external factors such as lack of good sound
__label__performance_assessment	I'm pleased with the captain's skills
__label__performance_assessment	I don't believe that it will change anything.
__label__technical	The video beam was damaged.
__label__subject	 It goes without saying that the main idea was unsuccessful
__label__subject	The whole idea makes me feel sick!
__label__subject	On the contrary, I think our mission is to protect them.
__label__technical	The work implements were a great help, they make everything easier.
__label__subject	If we go to such detail each time, will have finally a thorough view of the problem.
__label__performance_assessment	If everyone did their job it would work.
__label__subject	You are right, WTT needs to be improved.
__label__recommendations	We should be awarded for active participation.
__label__recommendations	It would be splendid to have that report emailed to everyone
__label__technical	I though that we can afford a microphone?!
__label__subject	People asked unnecessary questions.
__label__performance_assessment	 The talk was amazing
__label__performance_assessment	For the most part, though, her presentation was interesting 
__label__subject	I think that we've exhausted the topic.
__label__time	It was very long.
__label__recommendations	For the next meeting, I recommend presenting the work program by the previously disseminated agenda and remembering the objectives of the meeting.
__label__recommendations	I hope for the next meeting let the participants give their opinions
__label__recommendations	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should be given some materials from it.
__label__technical	The translation headphones had a connection failure, they did not allow me to understand the meaning of the words
__label__recommendations	It is not wrong to remember the names of the people and the reasons why they participate in the meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't feel like we've solved anything.
__label__subject	 From my perspective the proposed changes to WTO are absurd
__label__performance_assessment	 According to me the talk was fierce
__label__performance_assessment	 the talk was charismatic
__label__technical	Every time the speaker has a problem with the computer.
__label__recommendations	 Could you post a detailed interpretation of that law?
__label__subject	I’m not sure if this is a right way.
__label__recommendations	I recommend encouraging debate for upcoming meetings
__label__recommendations	You should let us know the purpose and reason for the meeting before it takes place
__label__subject	My daily duties would become much more tiring after this change.
__label__technical	The computers in the room are very old.
__label__performance_assessment	Great way of presenting.
__label__performance_assessment	For the next occasion we hope that the presenter invites the public to be part of the topic being discussed
__label__performance_assessment	The way he said it, he didn't find it interesting at all
__label__recommendations	Better leave us 15 minutes of questions and 15 minutes of opinions.
__label__time	The middle of the day is not the best time for such meetings.
__label__subject	Who proposed this topic for our session?!
__label__subject	He waited for the others to leave the command center
__label__performance_assessment	You have really improved since our last meeting.
__label__recommendations	You are a bit nervous, try to calm down, remember you are speaking to your friends
__label__subject	Can I see a written copy of the regulations that describe the procedure?
__label__performance_assessment	We saw a great performance last night.
__label__time	For reasons of time it was impossible to complete the main theme of the meeting
__label__technical	No place to charge our laptops!
__label__performance_assessment	A very nice presentation.
__label__performance_assessment	Noisy guy.
__label__recommendations	May I suggest that we postpone discussing this until the next meeting?
__label__recommendations	A little advice: keep it short!
__label__performance_assessment	Can you believe he shouted at us?
__label__time	Participants had time to ask questions and discuss them. 
__label__technical	The technical services must meet the particular needs of the participants
__label__subject	There is an extraordinary session from October till Christmas.
__label__time	I didn't think they would come and start so soon.
__label__performance_assessment	Everything was easy to understand, they really met my expectations.
__label__performance_assessment	Everyone wanted to leave before you finished.
__label__performance_assessment	The way of presentation was ridiculous.
__label__recommendations	If you disagree with someone, express it in a kind and respectful manner, that is, challenge the idea and not the person.
__label__recommendations	You should do more rehearsals before the meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	Without those meetings it would be harder to survive this time.
__label__time	I really appreciated that you’ve finished on time.
__label__subject	I have noticed that at the end of the day, Olivia is not able to focus on her task without despair.
__label__technical	How u can survive without a microphone?
__label__subject	All these are absurd rules
__label__performance_assessment	I have nothing to complain about.
__label__performance_assessment	I really appreciate your help.
__label__recommendations	You ought to be more polite.
__label__performance_assessment	What a wonderful story.
__label__subject	I don’t understand.
__label__subject	I find those subjects not practical.
__label__performance_assessment	 In my view the plan was calm 
__label__technical	I couldn’t read your tiny letters in the presentation.
__label__performance_assessment	All the staff did their job.
__label__subject	I’m of the opinion that the training was necessary and should be continued
__label__subject	Not knowing before who would present was problematic
__label__subject	She realizes  the commander was absurd
__label__subject	Many of the objectives defined at the beginning of the meeting were not met
__label__performance_assessment	I’d really like to write something polite regarding this presentation.
__label__time	You were late!
__label__recommendations	Please distribute the report only to those who participated in the meeting
__label__performance_assessment	No words to describe my disapproval to what I saw.
__label__performance_assessment	Very nice meeting!
__label__subject	Suddenly there was a great topic
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker should use the microphone, cos I didn't hear a word.
__label__recommendations	Keep things simple.
__label__performance_assessment	I hated it.
__label__performance_assessment	I was amazed.
__label__performance_assessment	The plan execution was marred by static characterizations
__label__performance_assessment	Finally when the speaker was changed it started to be interesting.
__label__performance_assessment	Every time I'm just looking forward for the end of that meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	You managed to engage the audience.
__label__technical	At the meeting, the sound was not good
__label__performance_assessment	We are always arguing during those meetings and nobody reacts.
__label__performance_assessment	It should never look like that!
__label__subject	The soldiers would cross the river.
__label__performance_assessment	Waste of money and time.
__label__time	I think that it was enough time for everything.
__label__time	I appreciate that the necessary times and schedules are planned, avoiding any excess that inhibits motivation
__label__performance_assessment	I appreciate the assistance
__label__performance_assessment	I liked the way you talk.
__label__performance_assessment	I love the man, he has such a sense of humor.
__label__performance_assessment	He was flexible with the questions
__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to listen to your speech!
__label__performance_assessment	After it all I was exhausted.
__label__recommendations	Maybe some materials would help.
__label__recommendations	Alex should have told you all this.
__label__recommendations	Everyone should see the video that was played during the meeting
__label__performance_assessment	She had a suspicious behavior
__label__subject	I don’t want to sit and watch such nonsense!
__label__recommendations	I would make tests after those lectures.
__label__subject	Perhaps we could ask the general if he has permission to leave the base?
__label__subject	I fully am aware of the topic, but the rest isn’t
__label__technical	Do we have some technical staff to help in emergencies at all?
__label__technical	Can anyone put the soup in the bathroom?
__label__subject	In this meeting I noticed that there is an increase in knowledge and development of social skills over the participants.
__label__recommendations	Can we deliver a copy to each team member?
__label__time	The practical part with exercises was too short.
__label__technical	I love it that you've added the e-mail reminder.
__label__recommendations	We should think about some new quest, that e can invite to our discussion.
__label__subject	It is not the first time this was brought up and I don’t see any improvement.
__label__performance_assessment	I would love to listen to the same prelection again.
__label__subject	 From my perspective the main idea is working
__label__performance_assessment	I hope I would be invited again.
__label__subject	I entirely disagree with what was said.
__label__recommendations	Someone should do better job when cleaning the meeting room!
__label__performance_assessment	My delight in them is as varied as my moods.
__label__recommendations	Require attendees not to interrupt others.
__label__technical	Technical problems delaying the whole meeting for so long shouldn't ever happen.
__label__time	The entire session lasted barely ten minutes.
__label__subject	The truth is we should promote this Navy-wide.
__label__technical	The speakers were broke.
__label__recommendations	They should prohibit mobile access to meeting rooms
__label__technical	I don't agree to give my e-mail address.
__label__subject	He had the satisfaction of being the first to put it into operation.
__label__recommendations	Do you homework next time!
__label__time	I hope your colleagues were also that punctual.
__label__time	After a few minutes of looking for his file, he finally started
__label__performance_assessment	His talk was amazing
__label__performance_assessment	 I’m of the opinion that the lecture is boring
__label__recommendations	I suggest changing the speaker.
__label__recommendations	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should have the right to vote.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker was boring.
__label__recommendations	We need someone to write down all the suggestions raised durin the session.
__label__subject	Paying so much attention to occasional issues hinders our overall perception.
__label__recommendations	They should not eat anything when presenting.
__label__performance_assessment	Congratulations.
__label__subject	Can the presenter do it?
__label__time	The exhibitor allowed to advance the topic clearly and with good timing, without losing the main rithm of each subject
__label__subject	His delight in plans frequently appears in memorandums written to his soldiers during summer
__label__performance_assessment	It's against our rules to shout at anybody and the speaker did it on our last meeting.
__label__recommendations	Don’t chat during the presentations
__label__performance_assessment	His delight is to know the law and show it to everyone
__label__technical	The wi-fi finally works.
__label__recommendations	You should work on your pronunciation of foreign words.
__label__time	I think that wee need three more meetings on the same topic, because it was not enough time to talk everything thru.
__label__recommendations	Maybe we could invite some quests?
__label__subject	I would like to discuss ways to facilitate it.
__label__performance_assessment	After your speech we had to go for a beer.
__label__recommendations	They should know better how to react in such situations in future.
__label__subject	True, if we are to win this, we should start working right now.
__label__technical	Can anybody fix those chairs?
__label__performance_assessment	The commander showed focus on the subject 
__label__performance_assessment	With all due respect, this was horrible.
__label__time	I would prefer spending less time on questions and more on practice.
__label__recommendations	More teacher for the practical part.
__label__subject	I totally disagree.
__label__subject	I'm glad that we discussed this topic today.
__label__subject	Last night we ran a session on the general email texted us about.
__label__subject	People were bored
__label__performance_assessment	Too short breaks.
__label__performance_assessment	After changing the rules of the meeting it started to work.
__label__recommendations	You better don’t talk so much or you will get boring
__label__technical	Do we have to use this broken chairs because someone is lazy or we lack funds?
__label__recommendations	Let's call him and ask him to accompany us. 
__label__performance_assessment	I hope he won't come here again
__label__performance_assessment	The presentation was very subjective and emotional.
__label__recommendations	I hope the commander can select the most suitable people to lead these meetings.
__label__performance_assessment	I really appreciate all your help preparing the meeting for the opening night.
__label__recommendations	I suggest renewing our knowledge about first aid.
__label__time	We got into the room and sit down for a few minutes in silence.
__label__subject	He should have faced the existing constrains and react promptly to lack of NDO
__label__performance_assessment	It was such a mess...some of us started even playing cards.
__label__recommendations	Maybe he should see a doctor.
__label__performance_assessment	I anticipated the delight of talking to my general 
__label__performance_assessment	He is a leader with charismatic ideas
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter was speaking so fast that I wasn't able to write down my notes.
__label__performance_assessment	In my opinion not everyone are involved enough during those sessions.
__label__technical	The chairs in the meeting room were quite comfortable.
__label__recommendations	We should get sth to eat.
__label__subject	To be perfectly clear, I am not saying the Internet and technology will solve every human ill.
__label__subject	Thank you for offering to jointly coordinate the Hospitality Committee.
__label__performance_assessment	Bad idea.
__label__recommendations	The meeting leader can continue to improve aspects of the meeting by concluding at the end of each meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	Thanks meeting was very polite
__label__subject	 From my perspective the main idea is not working
__label__performance_assessment	I don’t know what to say.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't suppose that anything would change after our discussion.
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter had the ability to persuade the public.
__label__recommendations	This was wrong, totally wrong, whatever we do, we should do it together.
__label__technical	The chairs are absolutely not comfortable.
__label__subject	Usually there is not enough men for the job.
__label__performance_assessment	I really appreciate your ideas and I am eager to implement many of your suggestions.
__label__time	I think that one meeting to discuss the whole idea wasn't enough.
__label__performance_assessment	These have been long and boring meetings
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't get what the speaker meant.
__label__recommendations	 If the nation goes to war, the military would need more of these devices
__label__performance_assessment	There's never too late to learn something more.
__label__technical	The place was inappropriate.
__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to hear such a good speech.
__label__performance_assessment	I saw an absurd ritual in that meeting
__label__time	I was late in my office because of the delay in the presentation.
__label__technical	The room is too small.
__label__subject	This is a cyclic meeting and I would expect fresh updates every time and what do I get?
__label__performance_assessment	Congratulations, your talk was really inspiring!
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter was poorly dressed.
__label__technical	There is no internet connection for assistants
__label__performance_assessment	I loved it
__label__time	You were very late.
__label__performance_assessment	When the opportunity presented itself, she grabbed it and make us listen to her story.
__label__recommendations	What do you say if we have rehearsal in that room by the headquarters building?
__label__performance_assessment	 According to me the major was good
__label__technical	Maybe if we were given sth to eat it would be easier.
__label__subject	I fear we should do even more.
__label__performance_assessment	 It seemed like the commander was hungry
__label__subject	The subject wasn't exhausted at all.
__label__technical	Please have a bigger screen for presentations
__label__recommendations	I would suggest for us to find a consultant next time when we will discuss such tough things.
__label__technical	The presentation on the computer was quite dense
__label__recommendations	The simple facts should be so much more convincing!
__label__performance_assessment	He was such a wonderful person in so many ways.
__label__performance_assessment	The speech was charismatic and inspired many listeners
__label__recommendations	I see a need of being informed about the subject of the meeting earlier.
__label__subject	That was a mistake in the performance of his duty.
__label__subject	I think that we've run out with the subjects.
__label__performance_assessment	It seemed to me that the guy that was giving the lecture was drunk.
__label__recommendations	Meetings must be an exclusive tool, which is only used when strictly necessary.
__label__performance_assessment	Our temporary sheriff is talking nonsense
__label__performance_assessment	Hey, that was really well said!
__label__subject	Was this really about operations?
__label__subject	The commander expressed enthusiasm towards new goals
__label__technical	The sound of the place was really adequate, everything was heard perfect
__label__recommendations	Try talking to the people seating in front of you next time, not to the room.
__label__performance_assessment	Very interesting.
__label__time	He did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave.
__label__subject	I hope we have more participation in choosing the topic of the next meeting
__label__subject	The attendees had the relevant data for the meeting.
__label__time	We’ll loose next war if everyone in the army cares about time so little as you do :(
__label__recommendations	I recommend delivering support material to make everything much easier.
__label__recommendations	We need a leader, chairman… someone to menage the meeting.
__label__time	There wasn't time for everyone to speak their minds.
__label__subject	I’m not sure if you give rewards for such small efforts will it bring any good?
__label__performance_assessment	We didn’t understand.
__label__performance_assessment	She made every possible effort to explain everything.
__label__time	It was time enough for all parts of the meeting.
__label__subject	I think the new way of handling these problems may be good.
__label__performance_assessment	You are a valuable member of our team, and I really appreciate your contributions!
__label__performance_assessment	With just one presenter it would have been enough
__label__recommendations	Before the meeting, the presenter should check that his objectives are clear and justify his need
__label__performance_assessment	I wish everyone had such meetings.
__label__performance_assessment	He explained with great detail
__label__technical	The meeting room had few chairs for so many attendees
__label__time	Good timing 
__label__performance_assessment	A look of satisfaction spread over the face of the creature before her.
__label__subject	I liked the topic.
__label__recommendations	What do you say if I help you next time?
__label__performance_assessment	I was surprised.
__label__recommendations	I recommend carrying out activities that encourage everyone's collaboration and participation to achieve the defined objective.
__label__recommendations	I would consider it useful to be introduced before such meetings.
__label__subject	The presenter repeated the same thing he said during the last meetings
__label__time	I appreciate you taking the time from your busy schedule to talk to me.
__label__time	Not all attendees arrived on time
__label__performance_assessment	"Thank you for preparing a ""report"" with the conclusions and agreements reached."
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't realize that our meetings can solve so many problems.
__label__subject	Kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers
__label__performance_assessment	Well done!
__label__subject	He found the transition plan was well done
__label__time	Meeting so early is nearly impossible for me.
__label__recommendations	I recommend that you take a break
__label__subject	Finally, everything has come together and we are ready to open the doors to the public.
__label__subject	 In my eyes the commander is not working
__label__technical	Nobody fixed the air conditioner till now.
__label__performance_assessment	A bit hesitating
__label__recommendations	I think that someone should take the responsibility for that accident that happened during our last meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	It is important to be constructive always
__label__time	Excellent work in the given time span.
__label__subject	 The plan is very well prepared
__label__performance_assessment	O.K.
__label__technical	No one answers my e-mail concerning our meetings.
__label__performance_assessment	As for first session it wasn't bad.
__label__subject	They were talking of the type of topics they are afraid will break
__label__recommendations	Using mobile phones should be forbidden.
__label__performance_assessment	It's great and I love it.
__label__subject	Water is everywhere essential to their well-being
__label__performance_assessment	It was a total disaster.
__label__performance_assessment	I envy u such meetings.
__label__performance_assessment	Great performance!
__label__subject	Four letters mentioned Rev. Martin and the wonderful work he and Annie were doing with 'the poor mistaken souls.'
__label__subject	I thought that we would discuss this topic and vote, but it didn't happen.
__label__recommendations	It is also important to talk about deadlines, actions or responsible for future tasks
__label__subject	It was incredible the possibility of giving an opinion at the meeting
__label__performance_assessment	I liked the story about general McKenzee
__label__subject	Instead I listened to his harangue about the difficulties they encountered
__label__recommendations	You should remind people to turn off their mobiles.
__label__technical	I didn't have a place to sit.
__label__performance_assessment	I’m glad the command is paying attention.
__label__recommendations	It should include ending all non-infectious diseases as well.
__label__recommendations	Everyone should obey the rules of our sessions.
__label__technical	Door to our meeting room need fixing.
__label__recommendations	In meetings, delays should not be allowed unless they are for a greater cause.
__label__subject	I remember similar topics covered in speeches during my initial training.
__label__subject	Maybe you’re right, but the more we spend on maintenance the less we spend on innovation.
__label__subject	From my personal experience it seems rather the opposite.
__label__recommendations	I’m not sure if going into such detail is useful.
__label__time	If you expect us to be on time with our duties, then set an example!
__label__subject	Is Mr. Smith the one with that authority? 
__label__subject	True, Navy does need to change in this aspect.
__label__performance_assessment	She discussed and interacted with soldiers
__label__performance_assessment	Well done.
__label__subject	The major shares information with peers and supervisors
__label__performance_assessment	 Some people say  the speaker is not credible
__label__performance_assessment	He is an expert
__label__time	The presenter left no time to ask questions
__label__performance_assessment	You are the most wonderful man.
__label__performance_assessment	How can this be achieved in the classroom?
__label__subject	Writing an act helps to remember.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker was certainly wrong person on wrong place.
__label__subject	Don’t you think it is about time we change this?
__label__performance_assessment	The general showed a negative disposition  
__label__subject	Can't wee finally talk about something important in our work?
__label__performance_assessment	I liked your style.
__label__recommendations	Instead, keep the dialogue open.
__label__technical	The internet connection area was quite fast at the meeting place.
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't have a pen.
__label__subject	Totally not useful meeting and topic.
__label__performance_assessment	I can imagine more useful skills that we can learn.
__label__subject	It would cost a million dollars and not even be as good as a our own product
__label__performance_assessment	I always have a problem with preparing my speech.
__label__performance_assessment	Could you imagine how wonderful it actually was?
__label__technical	One toilet isn't enough.
__label__performance_assessment	You expresses  concentration  
__label__performance_assessment	How on earth are we to achieve anything if we waste our time like this?!?!
__label__technical	It was too cold as always.
__label__subject	I can show you where that information stands out in the report and in the progress notes.
__label__performance_assessment	I was horrified.
__label__performance_assessment	During the whole session he organized and directed the opposition in their attacks on the officials.
__label__recommendations	We should get something to drink, while sitting those long hours.
__label__performance_assessment	Great precision.
__label__subject	I don’t think repeating the same story all over again will make it true.
__label__performance_assessment	Never experienced such thing.
__label__performance_assessment	The way you’re putting this is awkward.
__label__performance_assessment	I will not attend such meetings in the future.
__label__technical	I thought that wi-fi would be available.
__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to help you.
__label__time	I hope that next time we would again talk the same subject, because it wasn't exhausted during one meeting.
__label__time	The times coincided perfectly between each exhibition
__label__performance_assessment	I liked the topic but the presenting guy didn't manage to make me interested in listening.
__label__performance_assessment	Thank you so much for your help
__label__subject	Are you sure no one would follow?
__label__performance_assessment	This was a very boring meeting.
__label__subject	Are you convinced you’re right?
__label__performance_assessment	It was hard to part after the meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't like those yokes that the speaker used during presentation.
__label__recommendations	If the microphone is faulty it’s better not to use it….
__label__subject	The reasone for MTO to express such opinion was obvious.
__label__recommendations	Those meetings should be obligatory for all the staff.
__label__performance_assessment	I had an impression that the speaker wasn't sober.
__label__technical	Chairs are not comfortable at all.
__label__time	I felt myself very lucky to get time for my question
__label__performance_assessment	Great talk
__label__time	Meeting so late is hard.
__label__performance_assessment	The commander knows how to handle depressing news
__label__performance_assessment	Those attending these meetings see them as trivial and unimportant events.
__label__subject	The story you told us is a good example.
__label__technical	The translation was not heard.
__label__recommendations	Start at the announced time (at most, save 15 minutes of courtesy if many people are missing)
__label__recommendations	I would plan those meetings more in advance.
__label__subject	Can you remind me what was this all about?
__label__performance_assessment	 According to me the story is interesting
__label__recommendations	Hopefully you can create something like a roadmap that ensures that what you have worked at the meeting will be useful and certainly productive
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter mixed the topics.
__label__recommendations	We should have a right to vote.
__label__subject	Better write an email to everyone. Work meetings are a big problem for many organizations
__label__subject	We can search for some new inspiration and new subjects to discuss.
__label__time	The new guy showed punctuality  
__label__performance_assessment	I had a wonderful time at the meeting
__label__time	It was too long.
__label__recommendations	I would give certificates those who passed exams at the end
__label__technical	The enumeration of the chairs for each assistant would be perfect, there would be more order.
__label__recommendations	Maybe shorter presentations would be better.
__label__performance_assessment	Waste of our time.
__label__time	They commenced another session without even bothering to give people a 3 minute break.
__label__performance_assessment	Your description of the problem was thorough.
__label__recommendations	Please leave something to take notes on
__label__performance_assessment	He is always consistent
__label__subject	I think the plan is credible
__label__technical	The pointer did not work well.
__label__subject	I recall seeing this somewhere already.
__label__technical	I think that we are worth more comfortable place for meetings.
__label__recommendations	I think that it would be better if we divided time on practical part and lecture.
__label__performance_assessment	I was taught to introduce myself at the beginning, but that young speaker didn't bother to do it...
__label__recommendations	Women and men should not practice in the same group.
__label__subject	I don't like discussing the same thing all the time.
__label__subject	The more I think about what you’ve said the more I feel intrigued.
__label__subject	You divided the problem in 4 groups, but I think 6 would do better.
__label__technical	For the next meeting please bring a mouse to the computers.
__label__time	He cannot accomplish all of the agenda items during the allotted time
__label__performance_assessment	The meetings are important but have been discredited by the lack of specificity and organization around them
__label__performance_assessment	Maybe this isn’t polite, but true: you really messed things up this time!
__label__subject	Then with great labor he began to widen the passageway and everyone moved.
__label__performance_assessment	Challenging.
__label__subject	Okay, you think that won't work for Olivia. 
__label__subject	Many of the issues discussed at the meeting could be resolved with a simple email.
__label__performance_assessment	I love our new phantoms.
__label__technical	Lack of toilet paper.
__label__performance_assessment	It was not difficult, however, to make her understand that there was a present for each soldier, and to her great delight she was permitted to hand the gifts to them
__label__performance_assessment	If all meetings were like this, I’d love to come more often.
__label__performance_assessment	I really have better things to do.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker sounded like he had no idea about the case.
__label__performance_assessment	It's hard to think of any things that the organizers can change.
__label__performance_assessment	He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum
__label__performance_assessment	You handled the audience perfectly.
__label__subject	I have the impression you wanted to say something different.
__label__time	The meeting took a long time.
__label__subject	your worries have not been heard
__label__time	The presenter was speaking very fast because there was not enough time to cover all topics
__label__time	Susana earned extra time at the meeting to get 5 questions right.
__label__technical	The sound was too loud.
__label__recommendations	Maybe it's not so hard to organize some catering.
__label__recommendations	Please, the organizers must identify the people who must participate.
__label__subject	I’m not sure why but I feel this is wrong.
__label__recommendations	I see a strong need to make some new rules during our sessions.
__label__technical	Those chairs and tables are old and uncomfortable.
__label__time	Maybe more time for presentation would help us to understand the problem.
__label__time	Last time the meeting was very short in time.
__label__performance_assessment	She helps without begin asked
__label__performance_assessment	I hoped to get some more details, e-mail address or anything, from the speaker.
__label__technical	It was so stuffy in the conference room that I couldn’t focus at all!
__label__subject	She was wired with a different kind of energy after the sparring session
__label__recommendations	We should work more on this.
__label__performance_assessment	The meeting should have been canceled and and the matter should be dealt with in a more productive way.
__label__recommendations	You need to remove their opinion
__label__recommendations	I strongly recommend having lunches early
__label__performance_assessment	Breaks are to often.
__label__subject	My guess it’s because we’re there for a long time already.
__label__technical	It was quite hot in the meeting room
__label__time	You finished just before the time was over, good job.
__label__subject	There is a fierce competition between these two entities
__label__recommendations	Please send a list of topics to cover 24 hours in advance.
__label__performance_assessment	Excellent meeting a time well spent
__label__performance_assessment	Do you behave like this on all meetings?
__label__performance_assessment	After what I heard today, I can’t wait till the next meeting.
__label__recommendations	Apply the review in the fastest way right after finishing the activities to analyze.
__label__recommendations	Please avoid bringing family members to this kind of meetings
__label__performance_assessment	Now that is quality!
__label__performance_assessment	He is very kind to take the trouble to help me
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter deviated from the main topic
