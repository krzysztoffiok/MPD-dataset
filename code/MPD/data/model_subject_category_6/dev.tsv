__label__performance_assessment	Thank you so much for your help
__label__subject	True, if we are to win this, we should start working right now.
__label__technical	The computer is very slow
__label__performance_assessment	I let Tom know that I was dissatisfied with his presentation
__label__subject	I don’t know if the topic was good or bad as for now.
__label__performance_assessment	Thanks to that meetings I'm in better mood.
__label__performance_assessment	Everyone was enjoying 
__label__subject	I think that we've exhausted the topic.
__label__time	The exhibitor allowed to advance the topic clearly and with good timing, without losing the main rithm of each subject
__label__performance_assessment	I liked the story about general McKenzee
__label__performance_assessment	She showed lack of commitment  
__label__time	It was too short.
__label__recommendations	If you disagree with someone, express it in a kind and respectful manner, that is, challenge the idea and not the person.
__label__subject	He found the transition plan was well done
__label__subject	Four letters mentioned Rev. Martin and the wonderful work he and Annie were doing with 'the poor mistaken souls.'
__label__performance_assessment	From my experience, I know that half of the meetings are considered unproductive by their attendees.
__label__performance_assessment	The way you’re putting this is awkward.
__label__technical	Those chairs and tables are old and uncomfortable.
__label__performance_assessment	Well organized.
__label__recommendations	Each participant must commit to meet dates, and in case of any inconvenience they must raise it to discuss a possible change.
__label__subject	Water is everywhere essential to their well-being
__label__performance_assessment	100% performance.
__label__recommendations	Keep things simple.
__label__performance_assessment	The commander knows how to handle depressing news
__label__performance_assessment	It was such a mess...some of us started even playing cards.
__label__recommendations	The mentioned institutions should give more advice.
__label__performance_assessment	There was no harmony in this meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	Never experienced such thing.
__label__recommendations	If you present only general information, it is hard to imagine what the real problem is.
__label__subject	I am not in a position to make that decision
__label__performance_assessment	Great performance!
__label__performance_assessment	It was not difficult, however, to make her understand that there was a present for each soldier, and to her great delight she was permitted to hand the gifts to them
__label__subject	People asked unnecessary questions.
__label__recommendations	Everyone should see the video that was played during the meeting
__label__performance_assessment	I was better today than it was during previous sessions.
__label__recommendations	Please leave something to take notes on
__label__subject	If we go to such detail each time, will have finally a thorough view of the problem.
__label__recommendations	Wider room for us all.
__label__subject	We can talk about how we want to divide things and coordinate with the chairs about dates.
__label__subject	It would be continual mistake to pursue this line
__label__technical	Finally it wasn't so hot in the place.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker should use the microphone, cos I didn't hear a word.
__label__performance_assessment	I was amazed.
__label__recommendations	More teacher for the practical part.
__label__performance_assessment	Great precision.
__label__subject	The proposed frequency is to high, it will cause trouble.
__label__performance_assessment	I envy u such meetings.
__label__recommendations	Maybe suggest us to take notes next time?
__label__subject	We can search for some new inspiration and new subjects to discuss.
__label__technical	I don't agree to give my e-mail address.
__label__performance_assessment	At the time of that meeting it didn’t produce an effect upon me
__label__time	It's a pity that there was no time for comments from the quests.
__label__technical	No place to charge our laptops!
__label__performance_assessment	It's great and I love it.
__label__time	I really appreciated that you’ve finished on time.
__label__performance_assessment	When the opportunity presented itself, she grabbed it and make us listen to her story.
__label__subject	Why should we bother if there is more CTO then DAS?
__label__subject	Addresses were presented to him at Southampton, Birmingham and other towns
__label__performance_assessment	So many hours without a break?
__label__performance_assessment	All the staff did their job.
__label__recommendations	I hope someone is responsible for writing an email that recapitulates everything, orders ideas and prevents possible errors or confusion
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter was speaking so fast that I wasn't able to write down my notes.
__label__recommendations	I would suggest for us to find a consultant next time when we will discuss such tough things.
__label__technical	The presentation on the computer was quite dense
__label__subject	I think that we've run out with the subjects.
__label__performance_assessment	The general showed a negative disposition  
__label__technical	The technical services must meet the particular needs of the participants
__label__performance_assessment	Those attending these meetings see them as trivial and unimportant events.
__label__subject	The truth is they were engaged in combat and couldn’t do anything about it
__label__subject	The reasone for MTO to express such opinion was obvious.
__label__subject	Are you sure no one would follow?
__label__subject	 Generally it is thought that the review was not unfortunate
__label__performance_assessment	The meetings are important but have been discredited by the lack of specificity and organization around them
__label__performance_assessment	 According to me the major was good
__label__performance_assessment	Some of us have more important things to do, than to sit and stare on one picture for an hour.
__label__time	It was time enough for all parts of the meeting.
__label__subject	A young and innovative thinking according to the trend of your market.
__label__performance_assessment	His talk was amazing
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter deviated from the main topic
__label__recommendations	What do you say if I help you next time?
__label__performance_assessment	I know how much time and effort you have invested not only to do the project before the deadline, but to ensure that everyone is satisfied with each step of the process.
__label__subject	I didn't hear most important things.
__label__performance_assessment	I didn’t like your presentation.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't need those sessions.
__label__recommendations	You need to include someone who is able to take decisions about staff and financing
__label__subject	Not knowing before who would present was problematic
__label__performance_assessment	 From my perspective the commander not was good
__label__recommendations	They should not eat anything when presenting.
__label__technical	Those windows without curtains make it impossible to see anything on the screen.
__label__recommendations	Please make things more readable on you slides next time!
__label__recommendations	 If the nation goes to war, the military would need more of these devices
__label__performance_assessment	 I’m of the opinion that the meeting was not interesting
__label__time	The presenter left no time to ask questions
__label__time	I appreciate you taking the time from your busy schedule to talk to me.
__label__recommendations	You should do a better job next time
__label__performance_assessment	You are a valuable member of our team, and I really appreciate your contributions!
__label__technical	I'm still not on the mailing list.
__label__time	For the next meeting we hope to start and end the meeting at the planned hours
__label__subject	Government is a great achievement of civilization.
__label__recommendations	 Could you post a detailed interpretation of that law?
__label__recommendations	I recommend you say what the agenda will be at the beginning of the meeting
__label__performance_assessment	The presentation was accompanied by a kind of mathematical performance
__label__technical	Do we have to use this broken chairs because someone is lazy or we lack funds?
__label__time	If you expect us to be on time with our duties, then set an example!
__label__time	It was too long.
__label__subject	I don’t understand.
__label__performance_assessment	Maybe this isn’t polite, but true: you really messed things up this time!
__label__performance_assessment	He was such a wonderful person in so many ways.
__label__subject	This, according to general Franco, would be inconvenient.
__label__performance_assessment	In this meeting, I learned more than in the previous 10
__label__technical	Every time the speaker has a problem with the computer.
__label__recommendations	We should have a right to vote.
__label__time	When was the course suppose to end?
__label__performance_assessment	Hey, that was really well said!
__label__performance_assessment	The final part of the meeting was disagreeable
__label__recommendations	I recommend that the objectives of the meetings be defined based on the results of the metrics
__label__performance_assessment	Could you imagine how wonderful it actually was?
__label__recommendations	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should be given some materials from it.
__label__performance_assessment	I anticipated the delight of talking to my general 
__label__subject	The way of presenting the topic was surprising.
__label__subject	Finally, everything has come together and we are ready to open the doors to the public.
__label__performance_assessment	Finally when the speaker was changed it started to be interesting.
__label__technical	Finally somebody took care of all the technical problems.
__label__performance_assessment	I hate not having impact on what we discuss.
__label__performance_assessment	It should never look like that!
__label__performance_assessment	 Some people say  the speaker is not credible
__label__performance_assessment	I think that sticking to the schedule is not so important as answering all the questions.
__label__recommendations	I would make tests after those lectures.
__label__technical	The enumeration of the chairs for each assistant would be perfect, there would be more order.
__label__performance_assessment	The atmosphere of the meeting was warm.
__label__time	Meeting so late is hard.
__label__performance_assessment	I hated it.
__label__subject	 It goes without saying that the main idea was unsuccessful
__label__performance_assessment	She discussed and interacted with soldiers
__label__performance_assessment	If all attendees are clear about the objectives and topics to be discussed, the meeting will be better
__label__performance_assessment	He is always consistent
__label__technical	It was so stuffy in the conference room that I couldn’t focus at all!
__label__technical	The pointer did not work well.
__label__time	The entire session lasted barely ten minutes.
__label__performance_assessment	You handled the audience perfectly.
__label__recommendations	Someone should follow up on the commitments to make sure that they are really fulfill.
__label__performance_assessment	After it all I was exhausted.
__label__subject	Thank you for offering to jointly coordinate the Hospitality Committee.
__label__technical	Please have a bigger screen for presentations
__label__technical	At the meeting, the sound was not good
__label__performance_assessment	 I liked how the themes were synthesized.
__label__performance_assessment	A very nice presentation.
__label__subject	The truth is we should promote this Navy-wide.
__label__performance_assessment	Can you believe he shouted at us?
__label__subject	Who proposed this topic for our session?!
__label__subject	Paying so much attention to occasional issues hinders our overall perception.
__label__recommendations	I would contend that the size of this problem is substantially smaller than many people would guess.
__label__recommendations	I would change everything.
__label__recommendations	I recommend having a better dress by the exhibitors.
__label__performance_assessment	The commander showed focus on the subject 
__label__recommendations	What if next time we could just invite the important people?
__label__recommendations	We should get sth to eat.
__label__subject	your worries have not been heard
__label__time	He cannot accomplish all of the agenda items during the allotted time
__label__performance_assessment	How on earth are we to achieve anything if we waste our time like this?!?!
__label__recommendations	The simple facts should be so much more convincing!
__label__subject	Suddenly there was a great topic
__label__recommendations	We should be given a tablet or laptop during those sessions.
__label__subject	It would cost a million dollars and not even be as good as a our own product
__label__performance_assessment	"Thank you for preparing a ""report"" with the conclusions and agreements reached."
__label__time	Everything was on time.
__label__recommendations	There are tools that allow you to discuss many issues in an orderly manner and without the need to see yourself in person.
__label__recommendations	You better don’t talk so much or you will get boring
__label__subject	That was a mistake in the performance of his duty.
__label__subject	The chain of command was not working
__label__time	The meeting took a long time.
__label__performance_assessment	I really liked your presentation.
__label__recommendations	Start at the announced time (at most, save 15 minutes of courtesy if many people are missing)
__label__performance_assessment	I was surprised.
__label__recommendations	The meeting leader can continue to improve aspects of the meeting by concluding at the end of each meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	I've never seen such a great speaker.
__label__time	Punctuality of the members is fundamental
__label__recommendations	That group should drop out 
__label__recommendations	Don’t chat during the presentations
__label__recommendations	Alex should have told you all this.
