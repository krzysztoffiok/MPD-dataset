__label__subject	True, if we are to win this, we should start working right now.
__label__technical	The computer is very slow
__label__recommendations	I think that we need some more fire training.
__label__subject	I have the impression you wanted to say something different.
__label__performance_assessment	 the talk was charismatic
__label__subject	I don’t know if the topic was good or bad as for now.
__label__subject	The  reward, when it was available, certainly presented a temptation.
__label__subject	Our main case wasn't discussed at all.
__label__recommendations	We should work more on this.
__label__time	The exhibitor allowed to advance the topic clearly and with good timing, without losing the main rithm of each subject
__label__performance_assessment	I couldn't focus on the case.
__label__performance_assessment	Congratulations.
__label__recommendations	If I were you, I would do more slides with better figures
__label__subject	Of course, she knew Alex well enough now to know he didn't like people to hand out information about him.
__label__performance_assessment	Too short breaks.
__label__performance_assessment	I liked the way you talk.
__label__subject	Many of the objectives defined at the beginning of the meeting were not met
__label__recommendations	Please do not look at the cell phone while others speak.
__label__technical	Those chairs and tables are old and uncomfortable.
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't realize that our meetings can solve so many problems.
__label__performance_assessment	Very interesting.
__label__performance_assessment	Do you think it was nice to listen to all this negative stuff?
__label__performance_assessment	The idea of meetings is good.
__label__performance_assessment	Well organized.
__label__performance_assessment	I can imagine more useful skills that we can learn.
__label__technical	I didn't have a place to sit.
__label__subject	It was the highest time to discuss this topic.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker was a noisy guy.
__label__recommendations	Each participant must commit to meet dates, and in case of any inconvenience they must raise it to discuss a possible change.
__label__subject	I can show you where that information stands out in the report and in the progress notes.
__label__performance_assessment	These have been long and boring meetings
__label__performance_assessment	100% performance.
__label__subject	She was wired with a different kind of energy after the sparring session
__label__subject	Working as a team is the key for every company to develop, grow and not be affected by the high competition that exists today
__label__recommendations	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should have the right to vote.
__label__subject	 I guess frequent talking with people about such issues is working
__label__subject	Last night we ran a session on the general email texted us about.
__label__performance_assessment	It was such a mess...some of us started even playing cards.
__label__recommendations	For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed.
__label__performance_assessment	I always have a problem with preparing my speech.
__label__time	Susana earned extra time at the meeting to get 5 questions right.
__label__subject	There are members who answer emails, consult social networks or other tasks not related to the theme of the meeting
__label__subject	People asked unnecessary questions.
__label__performance_assessment	I was better today than it was during previous sessions.
__label__recommendations	I think we should find a new way of discussing our stuff.
__label__performance_assessment	Too long breaks.
__label__recommendations	Instead of getting angry, be practical.
__label__performance_assessment	During the whole session he organized and directed the opposition in their attacks on the officials.
__label__performance_assessment	We were all well informed for the first time.
__label__subject	The topics are very relevant to the problem in question.
__label__recommendations	I recommend encouraging debate for upcoming meetings
__label__performance_assessment	A bit hesitating
__label__subject	Thank you very much for meeting with me yesterday regarding my current project.
__label__performance_assessment	I liked the topic but the presenting guy didn't manage to make me interested in listening.
__label__performance_assessment	She is very attentive to detail
__label__technical	No place to charge our laptops!
__label__performance_assessment	That afternoon Christopher had a wonderful story to tell.
__label__subject	Do you think you’ll convince people simply by repeating your version?
__label__time	I really appreciated that you’ve finished on time.
__label__performance_assessment	She had a suspicious behavior
__label__performance_assessment	His delight is to know the law and show it to everyone
__label__technical	Can anybody fix those chairs?
__label__technical	Do we have some technical staff to help in emergencies at all?
__label__subject	Suddenly there was a great news
__label__subject	Okay, you think that won't work for Olivia. 
__label__subject	 the problem was interesting
__label__subject	Writing an act helps to remember.
__label__subject	The attendees had the relevant data for the meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	The general showed a negative disposition  
__label__time	The new guy showed punctuality  
__label__technical	The technical services must meet the particular needs of the participants
__label__subject	Usually there is not enough men for the job.
__label__subject	Are you sure no one would follow?
__label__time	I appreciate you started on time.
__label__subject	A leader is someone who knows the way, walks the way and shows the way. 
__label__subject	Perhaps we could ask the general if he has permission to leave the base?
__label__subject	 In my eyes the commander is not working
__label__time	He is always late.
__label__recommendations	You should let us know the purpose and reason for the meeting before it takes place
__label__subject	 From my perspective the proposed changes to WTO are absurd
__label__subject	There should be a leader who has enough sensitivity to identify how he can empower each component of his team.
__label__recommendations	Prevent the commitments made at the meeting from being forgotten.
__label__time	Unfortunately the speaker did not have time to close the idea
__label__time	I think that it was enough time for everything.
__label__performance_assessment	A look of satisfaction spread over the face of the creature before her.
__label__performance_assessment	Too many abbreviations.
__label__time	A pity not everyone knows how to be as punctual as you are!
__label__subject	I find those subjects not practical.
__label__recommendations	We can divide into groups by our own.
__label__recommendations	A little advice: keep it short!
__label__technical	The internet connection area was quite fast at the meeting place.
__label__subject	it's a long conversation about what's going wrong
__label__recommendations	I would consider it useful to be introduced before such meetings.
__label__recommendations	It is also important to talk about deadlines, actions or responsible for future tasks
__label__subject	 I’m of the opinion that the review was poor
__label__performance_assessment	You are a valuable member of our team, and I really appreciate your contributions!
__label__recommendations	We all hope that the quality of information improves
__label__performance_assessment	Without those meetings it would be harder to survive this time.
__label__time	20 minutes late is too late.
__label__subject	I was hoping to hear more about this idea.
__label__recommendations	I see a need of being informed about the subject of the meeting earlier.
__label__subject	 Some people say that the review process does not work
__label__recommendations	I recommend you say what the agenda will be at the beginning of the meeting
__label__subject	I will make sure to send you a follow-up when this project is completed.
__label__performance_assessment	He showed knowledge  
__label__subject	The data regarding Afganistan was really up to date.
__label__time	It was too long.
__label__performance_assessment	If all meetings were like this, I’d love to come more often.
__label__recommendations	They should know better how to react in such situations in future.
__label__subject	On one hand I understand your point, on the other hand I disagree
__label__technical	The remote control to the air conditioner is still missing.
__label__recommendations	Why don’t you do some deeper research in the topic?
__label__recommendations	Everyone should obey the rules of our sessions.
__label__subject	I’m of the opinion that the training was necessary and should be continued
__label__performance_assessment	I anticipated the delight of talking to my general 
__label__performance_assessment	We all started arguing and nobody reacted and took care of the situation.
__label__technical	Can anyone put the soup in the bathroom?
__label__subject	On the contrary, I think our mission is to protect them.
__label__performance_assessment	I think the commander was depressing
__label__technical	Finally somebody took care of all the technical problems.
__label__subject	I hope we have more participation in choosing the topic of the next meeting
__label__performance_assessment	I hate not having impact on what we discuss.
__label__performance_assessment	 Some people say  the speaker is not credible
__label__performance_assessment	You managed to engage the audience.
__label__performance_assessment	 the training was not credible
__label__technical	The enumeration of the chairs for each assistant would be perfect, there would be more order.
__label__subject	I recall seeing this somewhere already.
__label__recommendations	Somebody who is not interested should have the right not to participate.
__label__time	Was the meeting supposed to begin at 12?
__label__time	You were very late.
__label__performance_assessment	You have really improved since our last meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	The speech was charismatic and inspired many listeners
__label__performance_assessment	After those meetings I always have so many new ideas.
__label__subject	But as time progressed, his obvious reluctance to propose a real solution presented a far more difficult problem.
__label__recommendations	It would be splendid to have that report emailed to everyone
__label__performance_assessment	I appreciated all the examples
__label__performance_assessment	I don't believe that it will change anything.
__label__recommendations	He needs to take out that phrase
__label__time	I understand that there are only 15 minutes left before this meeting ends
__label__recommendations	She should discuss all this with Alex.
__label__technical	Please have a bigger screen for presentations
__label__technical	Some headphones did not work.
__label__recommendations	I think that changing the speaker would help.
__label__subject	Reading and answering emails breaks the work dynamics a lot
__label__recommendations	If the microphone is faulty it’s better not to use it….
__label__subject	All these are absurd rules
__label__subject	I think the plan is credible
__label__recommendations	We should think about some new quest, that e can invite to our discussion.
__label__recommendations	Maybe we could invite some quests?
__label__performance_assessment	Challenging.
__label__performance_assessment	He is an expert
__label__performance_assessment	I can see his lack of commitment to job
__label__subject	Paying so much attention to occasional issues hinders our overall perception.
__label__subject	 Some people say  the meeting was not useful because they heard already about the latter
__label__recommendations	I recommend having a better dress by the exhibitors.
__label__time	60 minutes was way too much for this subject.
__label__subject	In this meeting I noticed that there is an increase in knowledge and development of social skills over the participants.
__label__subject	His delight in plans frequently appears in memorandums written to his soldiers during summer
__label__performance_assessment	 The talk was amazing
__label__performance_assessment	 The training was boring
__label__subject	Suddenly there was a great topic
__label__recommendations	I’m not sure if going into such detail is useful.
__label__subject	I didn’t like the topic.
__label__performance_assessment	This was a very boring meeting.
__label__recommendations	You better don’t talk so much or you will get boring
__label__subject	That was a mistake in the performance of his duty.
__label__recommendations	Maybe it's not so hard to organize some catering.
__label__technical	I love it that you've added the e-mail reminder.
__label__recommendations	I would prefer to hear few words of explanation before presentation of the problem.
__label__performance_assessment	One of the guys stood up and started shouting and nobody cared.
__label__recommendations	If I were you I would let them ask questions any time.
__label__time	The meeting took a long time.
__label__performance_assessment	I really liked your presentation.
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't like those yokes that the speaker used during presentation.
__label__subject	I remember similar topics covered in speeches during my initial training.
__label__performance_assessment	I was surprised.
__label__performance_assessment	With all due respect, this was horrible.
__label__recommendations	Before the meeting, the presenter should check that his objectives are clear and justify his need
__label__subject	I think the real problem is elsewhere.
__label__technical	No one has such old machines to practice.
