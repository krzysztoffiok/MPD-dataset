__label__positive	The attention he garnered amazed him.
__label__negative	The computer is very slow
__label__positive	The  reward, when it was available, certainly presented a temptation.
__label__positive	I liked the story about general McKenzee
__label__negative	I didn't think they would come and start so soon.
__label__negative	Too short breaks.
__label__positive	Four letters mentioned Rev. Martin and the wonderful work he and Annie were doing with 'the poor mistaken souls.'
__label__negative	The speakers were broke.
__label__positive	I liked the way you talk.
__label__negative	The way you’re putting this is awkward.
__label__neutral	What do you say if we have rehearsal in that room by the headquarters building?
__label__positive	I didn't realize that our meetings can solve so many problems.
__label__negative	I wish I didn’t go to this meeting
__label__positive	Well organized.
__label__positive	He is very kind to take the trouble to help me
__label__negative	I can imagine more useful skills that we can learn.
__label__positive	 From my view point the plan was helpful
__label__positive	You started right on time which is appreciated.
__label__negative	The speaker was a noisy guy.
__label__negative	I was on time and there was nobody in the room.
__label__negative	The speaker got me really bored.
__label__neutral	I suggest renewing our knowledge about first aid.
__label__positive	Working as a team is the key for every company to develop, grow and not be affected by the high competition that exists today
__label__negative	The presenter was not serious in the assessments he made
__label__neutral	This wasn’t great but wasn’t bad either.
__label__negative	I think that one meeting to discuss the whole idea wasn't enough.
__label__negative	It was such a mess...some of us started even playing cards.
__label__negative	You divided the problem in 4 groups, but I think 6 would do better.
__label__negative	It is not the first time this was brought up and I don’t see any improvement.
__label__positive	I’m glad the command is paying attention.
__label__positive	The presenter projects a good professional image.
__label__positive	It sounds like a real adventure!
__label__neutral	Next time, please start earlier
__label__neutral	I finally understood what you mean in the very last minutes of your speech.
__label__neutral	Please leave something to take notes on
__label__negative	The speaker was boring.
__label__positive	If we go to such detail each time, will have finally a thorough view of the problem.
__label__neutral	I'll suggest more time for answering questions.
__label__negative	I thought that wi-fi would be available.
__label__negative	It would be continual mistake to pursue this line
__label__negative	I was late in my office because of the delay in the presentation.
__label__neutral	There should be no selective reduction.
__label__positive	The topics are very relevant to the problem in question.
__label__positive	Finally it wasn't so hot in the place.
__label__negative	This was wrong, totally wrong, whatever we do, we should do it together.
__label__negative	A bit hesitating
__label__positive	It's hard to think of any things that the organizers can change.
__label__neutral	More teacher for the practical part.
__label__positive	Timely starting your meetings would be much appreciated.
__label__positive	Great precision.
__label__positive	Everything was easy to understand, they really met my expectations.
__label__positive	I envy u such meetings.
__label__neutral	Maybe suggest us to take notes next time?
__label__negative	It was so crowdy today that it was hard to breath.
__label__negative	After a few minutes of looking for his file, he finally started
__label__neutral	I think that it would be better if we divided time on practical part and lecture.
__label__negative	The translation headphones had a connection failure, they did not allow me to understand the meaning of the words
__label__negative	Do you think you’ll convince people simply by repeating your version?
__label__negative	Last time the meeting was very short in time.
__label__negative	After your speech we had to go for a beer.
__label__neutral	We should get something to drink, while sitting those long hours.
__label__positive	All the staff did their job.
__label__positive	He explained with great detail
__label__neutral	Next time, please let us know in advance the day and time of the meeting
__label__negative	The chairs are absolutely not comfortable.
__label__positive	You finished just before the time was over, good job.
__label__neutral	There are not enough windows that we could open, it was hard to breathe.
__label__positive	 In my opinion the commander is good
__label__neutral	We need more fun.
__label__negative	The problem is we talk to little about this.
__label__negative	Those attending these meetings see them as trivial and unimportant events.
__label__negative	The truth is they were engaged in combat and couldn’t do anything about it
__label__negative	 In my eyes the commander is not working
__label__neutral	I didn't have a pen.
__label__positive	Excellent graphics and statistical analysis.
__label__neutral	There is a fierce competition between these two entities
__label__positive	A pity not everyone knows how to be as punctual as you are!
__label__positive	Good job!
__label__negative	If I may, please keep your presentation to the subject more strictly!
__label__negative	I didn't hear most important things.
__label__negative	I find those subjects not practical.
__label__positive	I'm glad that there was no technical problems during this session.
__label__neutral	If I had remembered this it would have prevented some mistakes
__label__negative	Im definitely not the only one who thinks  the speaker was not fierce
__label__negative	It is hard to expect anyone to keep focused after a whole hour of densely-packed presentation.
__label__positive	it's a long conversation about what's going wrong
__label__negative	Waste of our time.
__label__positive	I liked that they organized the entire process in an orderly manner along with the necessary materials and classrooms.
__label__neutral	Let's call him and ask him to accompany us. 
__label__positive	The times coincided perfectly between each exhibition
__label__negative	It is important to be constructive always
__label__positive	Without those meetings it would be harder to survive this time.
__label__negative	One toilet isn't enough.
__label__neutral	Better write an email to everyone. Work meetings are a big problem for many organizations
__label__negative	I see a need of being informed about the subject of the meeting earlier.
__label__neutral	Meetings must be an exclusive tool, which is only used when strictly necessary.
__label__neutral	Kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers
__label__neutral	The presentation was accompanied by a kind of mathematical performance
__label__neutral	I will make sure to send you a follow-up when this project is completed.
__label__negative	Do we have to use this broken chairs because someone is lazy or we lack funds?
__label__positive	She is a fierce fighter
__label__neutral	They should know better how to react in such situations in future.
__label__neutral	I think that wee need three more meetings on the same topic, because it was not enough time to talk everything thru.
__label__neutral	You are a bit nervous, try to calm down, remember you are speaking to your friends
__label__negative	Maybe this isn’t polite, but true: you really messed things up this time!
__label__neutral	You should replay that part and see it for yourself
__label__neutral	It is useful to have someone who has had experience with similar problems in previous projects to talk to.
__label__negative	I never get the information about the time of the session.
__label__neutral	Can the presenter do it?
__label__negative	The subject wasn't exhausted at all.
__label__positive	It's easier to spend all those hours in the room after the renovation.
__label__neutral	Next time, a larger showroom would be much better.
__label__positive	I had a very wonderful time at the meeting
__label__neutral	Better leave us 15 minutes of questions and 15 minutes of opinions.
__label__negative	Why don’t you do some deeper research in the topic?
__label__neutral	I wonder how long did you prepare for this presentation?
__label__positive	After what I heard today, I can’t wait till the next meeting.
__label__neutral	My delight in them is as varied as my moods.
__label__positive	Hey, that was really well said!
__label__positive	Great figures and tables!
__label__negative	It was too cold as always.
__label__negative	The way that major was presenting guests was strongly inappropriate.
__label__neutral	How can we improve our execution?
__label__neutral	On the contrary, I think our mission is to protect them.
__label__neutral	Using mobile phones should be forbidden.
__label__negative	I hate not having impact on what we discuss.
__label__negative	The meeting was extended leaving us with little time for the most important part
__label__neutral	I don’t know what to say.
__label__negative	I didn't get what the speaker meant.
__label__neutral	I think that sticking to the schedule is not so important as answering all the questions.
__label__neutral	I would make tests after those lectures.
__label__negative	Too many not answered questions.
__label__neutral	I see a strong need to make some new rules during our sessions.
__label__negative	I hated it.
__label__neutral	Was the meeting supposed to begin at 12?
__label__negative	I didn't hear most important things because of the microphone.
__label__positive	You have really improved since our last meeting.
__label__positive	The speech was charismatic and inspired many listeners
__label__neutral	I also have something to say in today’s topic.
__label__negative	You should remind people to turn off their mobiles.
__label__negative	I hoped to get some more details, e-mail address or anything, from the speaker.
__label__positive	I like the idea of seeing movies as material, we can use that way of learning more often.
__label__positive	If all attendees are clear about the objectives and topics to be discussed, the meeting will be better
__label__neutral	Instead, keep the dialogue open.
__label__positive	He is always consistent
__label__neutral	He needs to take out that phrase
__label__neutral	I like watching films during presentation, why don’t we see more of them?
__label__negative	It was really upsetting to hear their story.
__label__neutral	Someone should follow up on the commitments to make sure that they are really fulfill.
__label__neutral	Please have a bigger screen for presentations
__label__negative	At the meeting, the sound was not good
__label__negative	All these are absurd rules
__label__positive	I think the plan is credible
__label__neutral	I think that the microphone should be given to those who have something interesting to say.
__label__negative	And again no results.
__label__neutral	We should think about some new quest, that e can invite to our discussion.
__label__neutral	The topics could vary more between themselves.
__label__negative	There's no time for such things.
__label__negative	Who proposed this topic for our session?!
__label__negative	I would change everything.
__label__negative	60 minutes was way too much for this subject.
__label__neutral	I felt myself very lucky to get time for my question
__label__positive	I appreciate that the necessary times and schedules are planned, avoiding any excess that inhibits motivation
__label__positive	 From my perspective the competition was excellent
__label__negative	How on earth are we to achieve anything if we waste our time like this?!?!
__label__negative	I think he can do a better job
__label__negative	There is no internet connection for assistants
__label__neutral	Although you have all been to the same meeting, it is possible that there may be misunderstandings, it is important to make clear the conclusions and next steps
__label__negative	This was a very boring meeting.
__label__neutral	Maybe some materials would help.
__label__positive	Thanks for your time
__label__negative	Too many digressions.
__label__positive	Starting and finishing on time was appreciated.
__label__positive	I really liked your presentation.
__label__neutral	Please, the organizers must identify the people who must participate.
__label__positive	The meeting leader can continue to improve aspects of the meeting by concluding at the end of each meeting.
__label__neutral	Before the meeting, the presenter should check that his objectives are clear and justify his need
__label__positive	I really appreciate your help.
__label__negative	The video of the presentation failed multiple times.
__label__negative	The plan execution was marred by static characterizations
