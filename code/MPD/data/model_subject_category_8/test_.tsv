__label__performance_assessment	Thank you very much for the opportunity
__label__performance_assessment	Heading to nowhere...
__label__subject	In the other meeting I guess we heard the same things.
__label__performance_assessment	I hate listening to a man that never heard about the thing and gives lectures about it.
__label__recommendations	It is better to have new insights 
__label__subject	Did you mean we should check it every day?
__label__subject	This isn’t good information.
__label__subject	Perhaps, some of those strengths and strategies can help us find ways to solve problem areas
__label__subject	The director was astounded at having the case presented to him 
__label__performance_assessment	The talk was boring but the questions after were very interesting.
__label__recommendations	We need more breaks.
__label__technical	Waiting for help with air conditioner for half an hour was a nightmare.
__label__time	It could start few minutes earlier.
__label__subject	 In my eyes the information is interesting
__label__technical	I was too dark to make notes.
__label__recommendations	We can divide into smaller groups.
__label__subject	I can't imagine why he was trying to hide a thing like that from us.
__label__performance_assessment	 According to me the speaker was very stressed
__label__subject	It seems they call meetings only out of boredom
__label__recommendations	I would love to hear something about first aid next time.
__label__performance_assessment	Congratulations, really good job!
__label__recommendations	I see the need of talking it through again.
__label__recommendations	I recommend meeting again.
__label__recommendations	He should sometimes ask me first on such occasions
__label__subject	I’d love to hear more about this topic.
__label__technical	It was too hot.
__label__performance_assessment	We were all shouting so loud that I was voiceless afterwards.
__label__recommendations	The meeting room needs to be urgently remodeled
__label__recommendations	Once the meeting is over, request a brief pause to ensure that everyone agrees with the tasks to be performed.
__label__recommendations	We need more physical exercises than sitting and listening to lectures.
__label__recommendations	When there is high participation, the space changes and the meeting becomes much more productive and dynamic.
__label__technical	The emergency exit from the room is not working.
__label__subject	I fully agree, the NCO needs to take action.
__label__performance_assessment	People were speaking and laughing and nobody reacted.
__label__performance_assessment	I think that all we've learned on our last session was extremely useful in our everyday work.
__label__subject	Who chooses the topics here?
__label__performance_assessment	Their accusations are very accurate.
__label__performance_assessment	I was deeply engaged in the conversation
__label__performance_assessment	I am satisfied with the presentation of the topic, it was quite good.
__label__technical	I couldn't find the fire extinguisher.
__label__performance_assessment	I imagine that there are some ways to make the audience interested, but the speaker certainly didn't know how to do it.
__label__time	People say this was extremely insightful and well worth the time.
__label__recommendations	It is important to select a person who is responsible for taking all the notes correctly.
__label__performance_assessment	At first everything seemed slow and boring
__label__recommendations	Please arrive at least 5 minutes earlier than agreed.
__label__performance_assessment	The arguments that the major choose weren't convincing at all.
__label__recommendations	I would suggest meetings once a week.
__label__time	15 off time.
__label__performance_assessment	It was not enough participants.
__label__recommendations	Maybe try to get to the bottom of things earlier on.
__label__time	I recommend being more punctual in the presentation of each topic
__label__performance_assessment	Half of us was playing their mobile.
__label__time	The times prevented participation of the attendees even though these were important
__label__technical	How long can you have a problem with changing a light bulb?
__label__performance_assessment	This meeting encouraged me to try the new approach.
__label__recommendations	Why don’t you do some more exercise?
__label__recommendations	I' ll prefer more exercises than just listening all those hours.
__label__recommendations	Have you thought about preparing before coming to us?
__label__subject	We've heard a very interesting speech on a very tough subject today.
__label__recommendations	I would strongly recommend the organizers to change the schedule of the meeting.
__label__technical	How nice to have these new displays!
__label__time	The meeting was too long
__label__recommendations	We need more physical exercises than sitting and listening to lectures, as it looks now.
__label__recommendations	What about going out to do field work?
__label__performance_assessment	The way the meeting was held was outrageous.
__label__subject	Too many things in one time.
__label__performance_assessment	The whole idea to organize such meetings is absurd.
__label__recommendations	We should be gratified for participating in those meetings.
__label__performance_assessment	I think we should organize such meetings in our place.
__label__performance_assessment	I liked the whole presentation very much! Bravo!
__label__performance_assessment	This was a very interesting experience.
__label__performance_assessment	His face expressed more satisfaction with himself after the speech
__label__subject	If this worked, it would be a seminal accomplishment
__label__recommendations	I think that we should have some more impact on the topics that are chosen to discuss.
__label__technical	Maybe Wi-fi would help?
__label__performance_assessment	I could not understand the conclusion of this talk
__label__subject	The new companies have a horizontal and no longer vertical organization.
__label__performance_assessment	I liked that the contents were prepared in advance and there is a previous agenda specifying the topics to be discussed
__label__performance_assessment	The person responsible for leading the meeting can introduce himself and invite the rest of the group also to present themselves briefly.
__label__time	I think that we need more time to talk about that subject.
__label__subject	His actions during that battle will truly be remembered forever.
__label__subject	 In my view the plan was good
__label__technical	Without wi-fi it will never work.
__label__time	This meeting was a waste of time
__label__subject	The” discussed case” is not discussed at all for me…
__label__subject	We were really trying to follow these instructions.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker encourages everyone to participate.
__label__performance_assessment	You made me think about the topic after the meeting.
__label__recommendations	Identify what was learned at the last meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	 Personally, I think the lecture was good
__label__recommendations	Prepare and send the minutes.
__label__recommendations	I would choose something more interesting.
__label__time	The presenter was late for the meeting again.
__label__performance_assessment	He explain very well how  a ship came near and anchored in the little harbor.
__label__recommendations	You ought to do more exercise.
__label__recommendations	I would love to prepare myself before the meeting, but I didn't have the chance.
__label__performance_assessment	There was no fire training, besides the fact that we were told that we would be trained.
__label__performance_assessment	I wish we had more talks like this.
__label__subject	You may feel the need to defend your posture.
__label__recommendations	What alternatives do you suggest to address that particular need?
