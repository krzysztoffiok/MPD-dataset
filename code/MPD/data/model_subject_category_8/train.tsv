__label__subject	There should be a leader who has enough sensitivity to identify how he can empower each component of his team.
__label__subject	Many of the issues discussed at the meeting could be resolved with a simple email.
__label__performance_assessment	 The talk was amazing
__label__recommendations	Please leave something to take notes on
__label__time	Last time the meeting was very short in time.
__label__recommendations	You should replay that part and see it for yourself
__label__performance_assessment	Those meetings give me hope for a change,
__label__performance_assessment	 From my perspective the talk was not awful
__label__performance_assessment	I was surprised.
__label__performance_assessment	Now that is quality!
__label__time	There wasn't time for everyone to speak their minds.
__label__time	You finished just before the time was over, good job.
__label__technical	It was so crowdy today that it was hard to breath.
__label__recommendations	I like the idea of seeing movies as material, we can use that way of learning more often.
__label__subject	I think that we've run out with the subjects.
__label__recommendations	We need a leader, chairman… someone to menage the meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	She is very attentive to detail
__label__subject	Instead I listened to his harangue about the difficulties they encountered
__label__technical	Some headphones did not work.
__label__subject	How can we collaborate together to make this happen?
__label__subject	AWS should not play any part in the decision making process.
__label__recommendations	From my perspective the main idea presented in the course should be more often discussed.
__label__technical	The pointer did not work well.
__label__recommendations	Start at the announced time (at most, save 15 minutes of courtesy if many people are missing)
__label__performance_assessment	It's wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads!
__label__recommendations	The mentioned institutions should give more advice.
__label__recommendations	Hopefully you can create something like a roadmap that ensures that what you have worked at the meeting will be useful and certainly productive
__label__subject	Why should we bother if there is more CTO then DAS?
__label__subject	To be perfectly clear, I am not saying the Internet and technology will solve every human ill.
__label__time	Every time those meetings start at different time and end at different than it was written in a schedule.
__label__recommendations	What if next time we could just invite the important people?
__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to take part in such event.
__label__recommendations	That group should drop out 
__label__performance_assessment	Thanks to that meetings I'm in better mood.
__label__subject	I hope we have more participation in choosing the topic of the next meeting
__label__subject	A leader is someone who knows the way, walks the way and shows the way. 
__label__recommendations	If you disagree with someone, express it in a kind and respectful manner, that is, challenge the idea and not the person.
__label__performance_assessment	After this meeting everyone had good mood!
__label__subject	I would like to discuss ways to facilitate it.
__label__time	I appreciate you taking the time from your busy schedule to talk to me.
__label__performance_assessment	You managed to engage the audience.
__label__performance_assessment	Well organized.
__label__performance_assessment	I couldn’t stop looking at the clock, I wanted to get out so quickly!
__label__performance_assessment	We all started arguing and nobody reacted and took care of the situation.
__label__time	In my opinion five minutes is too short.
__label__performance_assessment	Great figures and tables!
__label__time	When was the course suppose to end?
__label__performance_assessment	Waste of money and time.
__label__technical	The computers in the room are very old.
__label__recommendations	Before the meeting, the presenter should check that his objectives are clear and justify his need
__label__performance_assessment	It was a pleasure to hear such a good speech.
__label__performance_assessment	 I’m of the opinion that the talk was not boring
__label__performance_assessment	Challenging.
__label__technical	It is really hard to focus with such noise outside the room.
__label__performance_assessment	I was amazed.
__label__technical	The meeting room was untidy.
__label__time	I didn't get there on time, I'm sorry
__label__performance_assessment	His talk was amazing
__label__subject	The topics are very relevant to the problem in question.
__label__time	I think that five minutes for every opinion is enough.
__label__subject	I’m not sure why but I feel this is wrong.
__label__performance_assessment	I loved it
__label__time	I understand that there are only 15 minutes left before this meeting ends
__label__subject	I have the impression you wanted to say something different.
__label__performance_assessment	For the most part, though, her presentation was interesting 
__label__subject	All these are absurd rules
__label__technical	I thought that wi-fi would be available.
__label__performance_assessment	Because the boredom of the lecture made me drowsy
__label__time	I really appreciated that you’ve finished on time.
__label__performance_assessment	The presentation was accompanied by a kind of mathematical performance
__label__performance_assessment	You handled the audience perfectly.
__label__performance_assessment	I think that sticking to the schedule is not so important as answering all the questions.
__label__time	Was the meeting supposed to begin at 12?
__label__subject	I don’t know if the topic was good or bad as for now.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker didn't answer any of the questions.
__label__performance_assessment	Thanks for your time
__label__performance_assessment	Not enough team working.
__label__time	A pity not everyone knows how to be as punctual as you are!
__label__subject	I don’t think this can be achieved.
__label__technical	Could someone fix the microphone?
__label__subject	I don’t understand.
__label__recommendations	There should be a leader, someone who would give a right direction to all those discussions.
__label__performance_assessment	This was a very boring meeting.
__label__technical	The translation was not heard.
__label__performance_assessment	He is a leader with charismatic ideas
__label__performance_assessment	I appreciated all the examples
__label__technical	The enumeration of the chairs for each assistant would be perfect, there would be more order.
__label__recommendations	Please make things more readable on you slides next time!
__label__performance_assessment	You expresses  concentration  
__label__subject	We need charismatic leaders in such situations
__label__recommendations	Perhaps we could bring guests for the next meeting?
__label__subject	True, Navy does need to change in this aspect.
__label__subject	Paying so much attention to occasional issues hinders our overall perception.
__label__recommendations	I would plan those meetings more in advance.
__label__technical	It was so stuffy in the conference room that I couldn’t focus at all!
__label__recommendations	Instead of getting angry, be practical.
__label__time	For the next meeting we hope to start and end the meeting at the planned hours
__label__subject	Considering the problems they presented, she could hardly blame him for that.
__label__recommendations	You should let us know the purpose and reason for the meeting before it takes place
__label__recommendations	Next time, a larger showroom would be much better.
__label__subject	She realizes  the commander was absurd
__label__subject	The presented idea may be eligible for the “idea of the month” award
__label__performance_assessment	Everyone was enjoying 
__label__recommendations	We need more fun.
__label__recommendations	I think he can do a better job
__label__subject	I am not happy with this solution, even if this problem was solved perfectly, it doesn't really end ignorance.
__label__performance_assessment	After what I heard today, I can’t wait till the next meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	I think that the microphone should be given to those who have something interesting to say.
__label__subject	Usually there is not enough men for the job.
__label__subject	Thank you very much for meeting with me yesterday regarding my current project.
__label__subject	 I hold the view that the remarks presented during the speech were unfortunate
__label__subject	The major shares information with peers and supervisors
__label__subject	 From my perspective the proposed changes to WTO are absurd
__label__recommendations	Try talking to the people seating in front of you next time, not to the room.
__label__subject	This time both arguments were presented 
__label__subject	In the ancient world, man wanted guidance from the gods on what he should do.
__label__subject	His delight in plans frequently appears in memorandums written to his soldiers during summer
__label__recommendations	There are tools that allow you to discuss many issues in an orderly manner and without the need to see yourself in person.
__label__subject	You divided the problem in 4 groups, but I think 6 would do better.
__label__performance_assessment	You have really improved since our last meeting.
__label__recommendations	You ought to be more polite.
__label__performance_assessment	It is a great experience
__label__performance_assessment	Too long breaks.
__label__performance_assessment	There was no harmony in this meeting.
__label__time	Meeting so late is hard.
__label__recommendations	Each participant must commit to meet dates, and in case of any inconvenience they must raise it to discuss a possible change.
__label__recommendations	We should have some impact on the results.
__label__subject	I think that we've exhausted the topic.
__label__recommendations	If the microphone is faulty it’s better not to use it….
__label__recommendations	I hope the commander can select the most suitable people to lead these meetings.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't suppose that anything would change after our discussion.
__label__performance_assessment	A bit hesitating
__label__subject	I don’t think repeating the same story all over again will make it true.
__label__subject	I will make sure to send you a follow-up when this project is completed.
__label__recommendations	Maybe suggest us to take notes next time?
__label__time	Every single part started late than it was scheduled.
__label__performance_assessment	I saw an absurd ritual in that meeting
__label__performance_assessment	Very interesting.
__label__technical	Every time the speaker has a problem with the computer.
__label__performance_assessment	It is important to be constructive always
__label__performance_assessment	I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your help with the project.
__label__subject	 I guess frequent talking with people about such issues is working
__label__recommendations	We don't need so many breaks.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't feel like we've solved anything.
__label__performance_assessment	We were intrigued. 
__label__performance_assessment	Good as always.
__label__subject	The story you told us is a good example.
__label__technical	No one answers my e-mail concerning our meetings.
__label__performance_assessment	The presentation was very subjective and emotional.
__label__technical	No place to charge our laptops!
__label__subject	I don't like discussing the same thing all the time.
__label__time	Can I ask you to finish your talk on time?
__label__recommendations	I hope you have better tests for the next meeting
__label__performance_assessment	Now this is what I call a speech!
__label__performance_assessment	Great performance!
__label__performance_assessment	I anticipated the delight of talking to my general 
__label__subject	We can search for some new inspiration and new subjects to discuss.
__label__technical	The video beam was damaged.
__label__performance_assessment	Your description of the problem was thorough.
__label__recommendations	You should do a better job next time
__label__subject	I'm glad that we discussed this topic today.
__label__recommendations	What do you say if I help you next time?
__label__subject	Don’t you think it is about time we change this?
__label__subject	A young and innovative thinking according to the trend of your market.
__label__performance_assessment	It was such a mess...some of us started even playing cards.
__label__performance_assessment	It seemed to me that the guy that was giving the lecture was drunk.
__label__performance_assessment	After those meetings I always have a headache.
__label__performance_assessment	During the whole session he organized and directed the opposition in their attacks on the officials.
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter deviated from the main topic
__label__performance_assessment	I don't believe that it will change anything.
__label__performance_assessment	Hey, that was really well said!
__label__recommendations	I think that someone should take the responsibility for that accident that happened during our last meeting.
__label__recommendations	Why don’t you do some deeper research in the topic?
__label__recommendations	Maybe shorter presentations would be better.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't need those sessions.
__label__recommendations	They should know better how to react in such situations in future.
__label__subject	I fear we should do even more.
__label__subject	Reading and answering emails breaks the work dynamics a lot
__label__subject	 It goes without saying that the main idea was unsuccessful
__label__performance_assessment	The way of presentation was ridiculous.
__label__performance_assessment	"A new meeting without results and focused on ""technical aspects""."
__label__performance_assessment	I had problems focusing my attention.
__label__technical	I didn't have a place to sit.
__label__technical	The sound of the place was really adequate, everything was heard perfect
__label__recommendations	You should be delighted to hear her opinion
__label__performance_assessment	He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum
__label__performance_assessment	Finally, a meeting where they do not extend with unimportant issues
__label__technical	The catering was better.
__label__technical	Chairs are not comfortable at all.
__label__recommendations	I think we should discuss urgent things.
__label__performance_assessment	An excellent idea that the people involved are summoned in advance and have sufficient information on the topics to treat
__label__recommendations	Could you please recommend how to solve this problem during your next speech?
__label__technical	The room was in a mass as always.
__label__performance_assessment	The speaker sounded like he had no idea about the case.
__label__subject	I thought that we would discuss this topic and vote, but it didn't happen.
__label__time	I expect my people to start on time.
__label__recommendations	Apply the review in the fastest way right after finishing the activities to analyze.
__label__technical	I didn’t get the message about the meeting.
__label__time	The presenter was speaking very fast because there was not enough time to cover all topics
__label__technical	The room was overcrowded.
__label__subject	The commander expressed enthusiasm towards new goals
__label__technical	For the next meeting please bring a mouse to the computers.
__label__subject	People were bored
__label__time	I came in a few minutes after the meeting should have started, but there was no one in the room
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't like those yokes that the speaker used during presentation.
__label__recommendations	It’s better to use the microphone.
__label__technical	The microphone was not working well
__label__time	It was too short.
__label__recommendations	Please avoid bringing family members to this kind of meetings
__label__subject	I would prefer to hear some new information, not things that we all already know.
__label__performance_assessment	Congratulations.
__label__performance_assessment	Unfortunately, this session was unsuccessful.
__label__time	I believe that the meeting lasted 30 more minutes, I did not expect it
__label__technical	Door to our meeting room need fixing.
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't realize that our meetings can solve so many problems.
__label__subject	I recall seeing this somewhere already.
__label__performance_assessment	He explained with great detail
__label__performance_assessment	Im definitely not the only one who thinks  the speaker was not fierce
__label__subject	Kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers
__label__subject	The meeting was full of topics that were simply not interesting
__label__technical	No time to pee during breaks.
__label__performance_assessment	Great job.
__label__performance_assessment	It was not difficult, however, to make her understand that there was a present for each soldier, and to her great delight she was permitted to hand the gifts to them
__label__subject	Writing an act helps to remember.
__label__subject	What are the consequences of having such diversity in a work group?
__label__subject	it's a long conversation about what's going wrong
__label__recommendations	We should encourage more behavior like this.
__label__subject	I entirely disagree with what was said.
__label__recommendations	Someone should follow up on the commitments to make sure that they are really fulfill.
__label__subject	Okay, you think that won't work for Olivia. 
__label__recommendations	We should think about some new quest, that e can invite to our discussion.
__label__technical	The air conditioner didn't work.
__label__performance_assessment	I really appreciate your help.
__label__subject	Can't wee finally talk about something important in our work?
__label__subject	I should like to be at home on Christmas day, but I actually don’t care.
__label__recommendations	I think that it would be useful to make a mailing list.
__label__recommendations	We should think about some new topic, more up to date.
__label__time	Maybe more time for presentation would help us to understand the problem.
__label__subject	If this is what the Navy thinks i’m terrified.
__label__performance_assessment	She is a fierce fighter
__label__subject	I think the real problem is elsewhere.
__label__performance_assessment	I did not like his plan and they way he put things on display
__label__technical	Can anybody fix those chairs?
__label__time	The entire session lasted barely ten minutes.
__label__recommendations	A person that didn't participate on previous meeting should have the right to vote.
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter was speaking so fast that I wasn't able to write down my notes.
__label__performance_assessment	The general showed a negative disposition  
__label__performance_assessment	I liked the story about general McKenzee
__label__performance_assessment	I think that listening to everyone’s complains for so many hour is a waste of time.
__label__technical	The computer is very slow
__label__time	I hope that next time we would again talk the same subject, because it wasn't exhausted during one meeting.
__label__recommendations	I would suggest thinking about better coffee during breaks.
__label__recommendations	All the participants should be provided with good equipment.
__label__performance_assessment	I hope I would be invited again.
__label__performance_assessment	There's no time for such things.
__label__performance_assessment	Never experienced such thing.
__label__subject	Our main case wasn't discussed at all.
__label__performance_assessment	I always have a problem with preparing my speech.
__label__performance_assessment	This wasn’t great but wasn’t bad either.
__label__subject	I think the plan is credible
__label__subject	The truth is they were engaged in combat and couldn’t do anything about it
__label__recommendations	If I had remembered this it would have prevented some mistakes
__label__time	He is always late.
__label__performance_assessment	 Generally it is thought that the topic is not interesting
__label__technical	I couldn’t read your tiny letters in the presentation.
__label__subject	I also have something to say in today’s topic.
__label__performance_assessment	We are always arguing during those meetings and nobody reacts.
__label__performance_assessment	I love our new phantoms.
__label__subject	A very good topic.
__label__time	The main presenter had a short time presentation
__label__subject	I share your point of view.
__label__recommendations	I’m not sure if going into such detail is useful.
__label__time	I think that it was enough time for everything.
__label__performance_assessment	Jhon appeared not the worse for the session, but he seemed ready for a nap.
__label__performance_assessment	After your speech we had to go for a beer.
__label__performance_assessment	"Thank you for preparing a ""report"" with the conclusions and agreements reached."
__label__technical	I'm still not on the mailing list.
__label__performance_assessment	I don't like you to talk like that.
__label__subject	I totally disagree.
__label__recommendations	They should prohibit mobile access to meeting rooms
__label__subject	And to this day, millions of people remember and honor the name of Gautama, as that of the great lover of men.
__label__technical	Noises from the outside made it unbearable.
__label__subject	 It seems to me that the major is working
__label__performance_assessment	I'm really impressed.
__label__subject	In my opinion you are right.
__label__performance_assessment	He was such a wonderful person in so many ways.
__label__recommendations	Please do your homework next time.
__label__recommendations	It would be splendid to have that report emailed to everyone
__label__performance_assessment	 The training was boring
__label__technical	Can anyone put the soup in the bathroom?
__label__recommendations	Maybe it's not so hard to organize some catering.
__label__technical	Please have a bigger screen for presentations
__label__subject	Every dead soldier has a face, a story, and a bereaved family
__label__performance_assessment	She made every possible effort to explain everything.
__label__recommendations	Although you have all been to the same meeting, it is possible that there may be misunderstandings, it is important to make clear the conclusions and next steps
__label__technical	The pens did not have enough ink
__label__recommendations	You need to include someone who is able to take decisions about staff and financing
__label__recommendations	It is not wrong to remember the names of the people and the reasons why they participate in the meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	I would tell this whole story in entirely different way.
__label__recommendations	I would make tests after those lectures.
__label__subject	Too many digressions.
__label__subject	On one hand I understand your point, on the other hand I disagree
__label__performance_assessment	So many hours without a break?
__label__technical	It was too cold as always.
__label__performance_assessment	 From my perspective the commander not was good
__label__performance_assessment	You get to meet all kinds of interesting people in that meeting
__label__technical	Those chairs and tables are old and uncomfortable.
__label__time	I think that one meeting to discuss the whole idea wasn't enough.
__label__technical	Do we have some technical staff to help in emergencies at all?
__label__recommendations	If I were you I would let them ask questions any time.
__label__performance_assessment	 Some people say  the speaker is not credible
__label__subject	 the problem was interesting
__label__performance_assessment	What a wonderful story.
__label__recommendations	Require attendees not to interrupt others.
__label__subject	It sounds like a real adventure!
__label__subject	Finally, everything has come together and we are ready to open the doors to the public.
__label__technical	The lights are too bright.
__label__time	He did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave.
__label__performance_assessment	Do you behave like this on all meetings?
__label__time	I felt myself very lucky to get time for my question
__label__recommendations	Wider room for us all.
__label__performance_assessment	Pure histrionics.
__label__performance_assessment	If everyone did their job it would work.
__label__recommendations	If I were you, I would do more slides with better figures
__label__performance_assessment	These have been long and boring meetings
__label__performance_assessment	She likes depressing stories
__label__technical	Technical problems delaying the whole meeting for so long shouldn't ever happen.
__label__recommendations	I'll suggest more time for answering questions.
__label__subject	It was incredible the possibility of giving an opinion at the meeting
__label__performance_assessment	I'm pleased with the captain's skills
__label__subject	The proposed use the command center was interesting
__label__performance_assessment	Thanks meeting was very polite
__label__performance_assessment	I hope it would be improved.
__label__subject	There is a fierce competition between these two entities
__label__performance_assessment	Congratulations, your talk was really inspiring!
__label__subject	Suddenly there was a great topic
__label__technical	I didn't hear most important things because of the microphone.
__label__recommendations	This was wrong, totally wrong, whatever we do, we should do it together.
__label__performance_assessment	It was an awful meeting
__label__performance_assessment	Your hesitation influenced the audience.
__label__recommendations	 Could you post a detailed interpretation of that law?
__label__time	I appreciate you started on time.
__label__recommendations	Please distribute the report only to those who participated in the meeting
__label__technical	All the cables lying around the room are dangerous.
__label__subject	People asked unnecessary questions.
__label__subject	He waited for the others to leave the command center
__label__performance_assessment	Let's talk about what is working.
__label__performance_assessment	Great precision.
__label__time	I didn't think they would come and start so soon.
__label__performance_assessment	 It goes without saying that the training was working
__label__performance_assessment	I appreciate the assistance
__label__performance_assessment	The guy that organized it should get fired at once!
__label__recommendations	Some of the participants should get a reprimand.
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't fall asleep but I was close to it.
__label__performance_assessment	A solemn meeting 
__label__performance_assessment	I don’t know what to say.
__label__performance_assessment	 Some people say that the meeting wasn’t boring
__label__performance_assessment	It's great and I love it.
__label__technical	Finally somebody fixed the air conditioning.
__label__recommendations	For the next meeting, I recommend presenting the work program by the previously disseminated agenda and remembering the objectives of the meeting.
__label__subject	The newest data shows something different from what you were saying.
__label__time	We got into the room and sit down for a few minutes in silence.
__label__time	Unfortunately the speaker did not have time to close the idea
__label__recommendations	Next time, please let us know in advance the day and time of the meeting
__label__performance_assessment	I liked it tat we could practice with our quests.
__label__recommendations	May I suggest to have hangouts and coffee?
__label__performance_assessment	Too many abbreviations.
__label__technical	Maybe if we were given sth to eat it would be easier.
__label__performance_assessment	Too short breaks.
__label__time	The meeting started way too late.
__label__recommendations	You should remind people to turn off their mobiles.
__label__time	You started right on time which is appreciated.
__label__performance_assessment	At the time of that meeting it didn’t produce an effect upon me
__label__subject	That was a mistake in the performance of his duty.
__label__performance_assessment	 I’m of the opinion that the lecture is boring
__label__performance_assessment	Excellent meeting a time well spent
__label__performance_assessment	The arguments that the major choose were convincing.
__label__performance_assessment	I finally understood what you mean in the very last minutes of your speech.
__label__performance_assessment	She helps without begin asked
__label__performance_assessment	The attention he garnered amazed him.
__label__performance_assessment	Do you think it was nice to listen to all this negative stuff?
__label__time	The meeting was extended leaving us with little time for the most important part
__label__recommendations	More attention to the matter would surely help.
__label__performance_assessment	I've never seen such a great speaker.
__label__recommendations	They should not eat anything when presenting.
__label__time	I was on time and there was nobody in the room.
__label__performance_assessment	The way you’re putting this is awkward.
__label__performance_assessment	It was hard to part after the meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	I really appreciate your ideas and I am eager to implement many of your suggestions.
__label__performance_assessment	Some of us have more important things to do, than to sit and stare on one picture for an hour.
__label__recommendations	If I may, please keep your presentation to the subject more strictly!
__label__technical	I don't agree to give my e-mail address.
__label__performance_assessment	The presenter was poorly dressed.
__label__technical	I though that we can afford a microphone?!
__label__performance_assessment	The commander knows how to handle depressing news
__label__recommendations	Better leave us 15 minutes of questions and 15 minutes of opinions.
__label__recommendations	It should be ready now, not in 2 months!
__label__performance_assessment	For the next occasion we hope that the presenter invites the public to be part of the topic being discussed
__label__performance_assessment	The commander showed focus on the subject 
__label__performance_assessment	In my opinion not everyone are involved enough during those sessions.
__label__technical	The sound was too loud.
__label__recommendations	Keep things simple.
__label__subject	There are members who answer emails, consult social networks or other tasks not related to the theme of the meeting
__label__technical	Is it possible to have less light during presentation next time?
__label__subject	I’m of the opinion that the training was necessary and should be continued
__label__technical	This meeting without access to WIFI was a mistake.
__label__recommendations	Somebody should lock the door after the beginning.
__label__performance_assessment	It was boring.
__label__recommendations	For next time go to the point and do not get off the subject.
__label__recommendations	Maybe he should see a doctor.
__label__subject	Why should that cause the masses to riot?
__label__subject	I have noticed that at the end of the day, Olivia is not able to focus on her task without despair.
__label__subject	The soldiers would cross the river.
__label__performance_assessment	I couldn't focus on the case.
__label__technical	Lack of toilet paper.
__label__performance_assessment	We were all well informed for the first time.
__label__subject	I don’t want to sit and watch such nonsense!
__label__recommendations	I think that we should get access to the address book with contacts to other participants.
__label__performance_assessment	Everyone wanted to leave before you finished.
__label__performance_assessment	If you complicate things don’t be surprised people don’t listen.
__label__subject	How can we improve our execution?
__label__recommendations	My colleagues would prefer you talk a little slower.
__label__performance_assessment	He is an expert
__label__subject	 In my eyes the commander is not working
__label__subject	Are you sure no one would follow?
__label__time	Excellent work in the given time span.
__label__subject	Better write an email to everyone. Work meetings are a big problem for many organizations
__label__subject	Perhaps we could ask the general if he has permission to leave the base?
__label__technical	How u can survive without a microphone?
__label__technical	The translation headphones had a connection failure, they did not allow me to understand the meaning of the words
__label__subject	I’m not sure if this is a right way.
__label__technical	Productivity was affected by external factors such as lack of good sound
__label__performance_assessment	It is hard to expect anyone to keep focused after a whole hour of densely-packed presentation.
__label__performance_assessment	That afternoon Christopher had a wonderful story to tell.
__label__recommendations	The minutes should include the issues addressed in it, the pending tasks, who should perform them and for when.
__label__subject	 From my perspective the main idea is not working
__label__performance_assessment	There's never too late to learn something more.
__label__recommendations	The simple facts should be so much more convincing!
__label__performance_assessment	 In my view the plan was calm
