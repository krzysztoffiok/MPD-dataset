__label__performance_assessment	Too short breaks.
__label__subject	Four letters mentioned Rev. Martin and the wonderful work he and Annie were doing with 'the poor mistaken souls.'

__label__subject	The presenter was not serious in the assessments he made
__label__performance_assessment	This wasn’t great but wasn’t bad either.
__label__time	I think that one meeting to discuss the whole idea wasn't enough.
__label__performance_assessment	It was such a mess...some of us started even playing cards.
__label__subject	You divided the problem in 4 groups, but I think 6 would do better.

__label__subject	The truth is they were engaged in combat and couldn’t do anything about it
__label__subject	 In my eyes the commander is not working
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't have a pen.
__label__performance_assessment	Excellent graphics and statistical analysis.
__label__subject	There is a fierce competition between these two entities

__label__subject	I didn't hear most important things.
__label__subject	I find those subjects not practical.
__label__technical	I'm glad that there was no technical problems during this session.
__label__recommendations	If I had remembered this it would have prevented some mistakes
__label__performance_assessment	Im definitely not the only one who thinks  the speaker was not fierce

__label__recommendations	Meetings must be an exclusive tool, which is only used when strictly necessary.
__label__subject	Kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers
__label__performance_assessment	The presentation was accompanied by a kind of mathematical performance
__label__subject	I will make sure to send you a follow-up when this project is completed.
__label__technical	Do we have to use this broken chairs because someone is lazy or we lack funds?
__label__performance_assessment	She is a fierce fighter
__label__recommendations	They should know better how to react in such situations in future.
__label__time	I think that wee need three more meetings on the same topic, because it was not enough time to talk everything thru.
__label__recommendations	You are a bit nervous, try to calm down, remember you are speaking to your friends
__label__performance_assessment	Maybe this isn’t polite, but true: you really messed things up this time!
__label__recommendations	You should replay that part and see it for yourself
__label__performance_assessment	It is useful to have someone who has had experience with similar problems in previous projects to talk to.
__label__technical	I never get the information about the time of the session.
__label__subject	Can the presenter do it?
__label__subject	The subject wasn't exhausted at all.
__label__technical	It's easier to spend all those hours in the room after the renovation.
__label__recommendations	Next time, a larger showroom would be much better.
__label__performance_assessment	I had a very wonderful time at the meeting
__label__recommendations	Better leave us 15 minutes of questions and 15 minutes of opinions.
__label__recommendations	Why don’t you do some deeper research in the topic?
__label__performance_assessment	I wonder how long did you prepare for this presentation?
__label__performance_assessment	After what I heard today, I can’t wait till the next meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	My delight in them is as varied as my moods.
__label__performance_assessment	Hey, that was really well said!
__label__performance_assessment	Great figures and tables!
__label__technical	It was too cold as always.
__label__performance_assessment	The way that major was presenting guests was strongly inappropriate.

__label__performance_assessment	I don’t know what to say.
__label__performance_assessment	I didn't get what the speaker meant.
__label__performance_assessment	I think that sticking to the schedule is not so important as answering all the questions.
__label__recommendations	I would make tests after those lectures.
__label__performance_assessment	Too many not answered questions.
__label__recommendations	I see a strong need to make some new rules during our sessions.
__label__performance_assessment	I hated it.
__label__time	Was the meeting supposed to begin at 12?

__label__performance_assessment	You have really improved since our last meeting.
__label__performance_assessment	The speech was charismatic and inspired many listeners
__label__subject	I also have something to say in today’s topic.
__label__recommendations	You should remind people to turn off their mobiles.
__label__performance_assessment	I hoped to get some more details, e-mail address or anything, from the speaker.
__label__recommendations	I like the idea of seeing movies as material, we can use that way of learning more often.
__label__performance_assessment	If all attendees are clear about the objectives and topics to be discussed, the meeting will be better
__label__recommendations	Instead, keep the dialogue open.
__label__performance_assessment	He is always consistent
__label__recommendations	He needs to take out that phrase
__label__recommendations	I like watching films during presentation, why don’t we see more of them?
__label__subject	It was really upsetting to hear their story.
__label__recommendations	Someone should follow up on the commitments to make sure that they are really fulfill.
__label__technical	Please have a bigger screen for presentations
__label__technical	At the meeting, the sound was not good
__label__subject	All these are absurd rules
__label__subject	I think the plan is credible
__label__performance_assessment	I think that the microphone should be given to those who have something interesting to say.
__label__performance_assessment	And again no results.
__label__recommendations	We should think about some new quest, that e can invite to our discussion.
__label__subject	The topics could vary more between themselves.
__label__performance_assessment	There's no time for such things.
__label__subject	Who proposed this topic for our session?!
__label__recommendations	I would change everything.
__label__time	60 minutes was way too much for this subject.
__label__time	I felt myself very lucky to get time for my question
__label__time	I appreciate that the necessary times and schedules are planned, avoiding any excess that inhibits motivation
__label__performance_assessment	 From my perspective the competition was excellent
__label__performance_assessment	How on earth are we to achieve anything if we waste our time like this?!?!
__label__recommendations	I think he can do a better job
__label__technical	There is no internet connection for assistants
__label__recommendations	Although you have all been to the same meeting, it is possible that there may be misunderstandings, it is important to make clear the conclusions and next steps
__label__performance_assessment	This was a very boring meeting.
__label__recommendations	Maybe some materials would help.
__label__performance_assessment	Thanks for your time
__label__subject	Too many digressions.
__label__time	Starting and finishing on time was appreciated.
__label__performance_assessment	I really liked your presentation.
__label__recommendations	Please, the organizers must identify the people who must participate.

__label__recommendations	Before the meeting, the presenter should check that his objectives are clear and justify his need
__label__performance_assessment	I really appreciate your help.
__label__technical	The video of the presentation failed multiple times.
__label__performance_assessment	The plan execution was marred by static characterizations
