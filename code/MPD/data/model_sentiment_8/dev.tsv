__label__positive	Thank you so much for your help
__label__negative	We’ll loose next war if everyone in the army cares about time so little as you do :(
__label__neutral	They were talking of the type of topics they are afraid will break
__label__neutral	One of the participants must be publicly responsible for recording in writing what was agreed at the meeting.
__label__positive	The  reward, when it was available, certainly presented a temptation.
__label__neutral	We should work more on this.
__label__neutral	I think that it would be better to meet more often and make the meetings shorter.
__label__positive	Great talk
__label__positive	Four letters mentioned Rev. Martin and the wonderful work he and Annie were doing with 'the poor mistaken souls.'
__label__negative	From my experience, I know that half of the meetings are considered unproductive by their attendees.
__label__positive	I liked the way you talk.
__label__neutral	I hope that sb would organize some sort of entertainment,
__label__negative	Many of the objectives defined at the beginning of the meeting were not met
__label__negative	 I’m of the opinion that the main idea was not great
__label__positive	The idea of meetings is good.
__label__positive	 From my view point the plan was helpful
__label__neutral	Water is everywhere essential to their well-being
__label__neutral	I suggest renewing our knowledge about first aid.
__label__positive	Working as a team is the key for every company to develop, grow and not be affected by the high competition that exists today
__label__negative	No words to describe my disapproval to what I saw.
__label__negative	The presenter did not review well the points that he was going to deal with
__label__neutral	I may be misunderstanding.
__label__negative	The room is too small.
__label__negative	It is not the first time this was brought up and I don’t see any improvement.
__label__neutral	I am not in a position to make that decision
__label__positive	I like it that we've change the place of our meetings.
__label__negative	It would be continual mistake to pursue this line
__label__negative	He should not listen to anyone who tried to persuade him to stay, he had his orders.
__label__negative	I was late in my office because of the delay in the presentation.
__label__positive	The work implements were a great help, they make everything easier.
__label__positive	You're a very interesting person
__label__neutral	There should be no selective reduction.
__label__positive	I think the new way of handling these problems may be good.
__label__positive	Finally it wasn't so hot in the place.
__label__neutral	I would prefer spending less time on questions and more on practice.
__label__negative	It was quite hot in the meeting room
__label__positive	It's hard to think of any things that the organizers can change.
__label__neutral	My guess it’s because we’re there for a long time already.
__label__positive	Everything was easy to understand, they really met my expectations.
__label__positive	I envy u such meetings.
__label__positive	It's not the first time that the organizer was late.
__label__neutral	I think that it would be better if we divided time on practical part and lecture.
__label__positive	When the opportunity presented itself, she grabbed it and make us listen to her story.
__label__positive	Addresses were presented to him at Southampton, Birmingham and other towns
__label__neutral	I hope someone is responsible for writing an email that recapitulates everything, orders ideas and prevents possible errors or confusion
__label__positive	I hope your colleagues were also that punctual.
__label__negative	You had better be prepared next time.
__label__negative	Bad idea.
__label__neutral	There are not enough windows that we could open, it was hard to breathe.
__label__negative	Do you homework next time!
__label__negative	The problem is we talk to little about this.
__label__neutral	I was a little late and I wasn't allowed to join the meeting.
__label__positive	 Generally it is thought that the review was not unfortunate
__label__neutral	We should be awarded for active participation.
__label__positive	 According to me the major was good
__label__neutral	I’m not sure if I understood correctly.
__label__negative	Be more specific about what you know and see in your team
__label__negative	He should use the microphone!!!!!
__label__positive	Excellent graphics and statistical analysis.
__label__positive	I liked your style.
__label__neutral	Can we deliver a copy to each team member?
__label__positive	I know how much time and effort you have invested not only to do the project before the deadline, but to ensure that everyone is satisfied with each step of the process.
__label__negative	The presenter mixed the topics.
__label__negative	I didn't hear most important things.
__label__negative	I didn’t like your presentation.
__label__negative	I totally disagree.
__label__neutral	We can divide into groups by our own.
__label__positive	One cause for the excellence of her letters is the great number of them.
__label__neutral	It is important to understand more effectively the actions or circumstances that affect the work team.
__label__negative	I didn't learn anything new.
__label__negative	A little advice: keep it short!
__label__negative	The topics don’t vary enough.
__label__negative	Waste of our time.
__label__negative	Not knowing before who would present was problematic
__label__neutral	I would consider it useful to be introduced before such meetings.
__label__positive	I liked that they organized the entire process in an orderly manner along with the necessary materials and classrooms.
__label__neutral	It is also important to talk about deadlines, actions or responsible for future tasks
__label__negative	 I’m of the opinion that the review was poor
__label__neutral	On the next occasion the presentation should be less extensive and much clearer.
__label__neutral	We all hope that the quality of information improves
__label__positive	Without those meetings it would be harder to survive this time.
__label__negative	I was hoping to hear more about this idea.
__label__negative	I really have better things to do.
__label__neutral	I don't know what to say.
__label__neutral	The soldiers should follow procedures
__label__negative	You were late!
__label__negative	Do we have to use this broken chairs because someone is lazy or we lack funds?
__label__positive	The data regarding Afganistan was really up to date.
__label__neutral	I’d pay more attention to details.
__label__negative	It was too long.
__label__negative	The presenter did nothing as planned.
__label__negative	Maybe this isn’t polite, but true: you really messed things up this time!
__label__neutral	I recommend that you take a break
__label__negative	I never get the information about the time of the session.
__label__negative	You should do more rehearsals before the meeting.
__label__positive	I wish everyone had such meetings.
__label__neutral	I’m not sure if you give rewards for such small efforts will it bring any good?
__label__negative	Noisy guy.
__label__negative	We had to wait 20 minutes after the agreed time.
__label__positive	I had a very wonderful time at the meeting
__label__positive	Then with great labor he began to widen the passageway and everyone moved.
__label__positive	The wi-fi finally works.
__label__neutral	Everyone should obey the rules of our sessions.
__label__negative	Every time I'm just looking forward for the end of that meeting.
__label__positive	I would love to listen to the same prelection again.
__label__negative	The final part of the meeting was disagreeable
__label__positive	The chairs in the meeting room were quite comfortable.
__label__positive	Could you imagine how wonderful it actually was?
__label__positive	I had a wonderful time at the meeting
__label__negative	The meeting was very crowded, some people even had to stand.
__label__negative	The meeting room had few chairs for so many attendees
__label__negative	I couldn’t hear in the back of the room
__label__positive	Finally when the speaker was changed it started to be interesting.
__label__positive	Finally somebody took care of all the technical problems.
__label__positive	 From my perspective the main idea is working
__label__neutral	I liked more the second part of the meeting.
__label__negative	Totally not useful meeting and topic.
__label__negative	They commenced another session without even bothering to give people a 3 minute break.
__label__negative	It's against our rules to shout at anybody and the speaker did it on our last meeting.
__label__neutral	Is Mr. Smith the one with that authority? 
__label__negative	I hate not having impact on what we discuss.
__label__positive	The presenter achieved each and every one of his goals
__label__positive	Very nice meeting!
__label__positive	I have nothing to complain about.
__label__positive	The atmosphere of the meeting was warm.
__label__negative	Too many not answered questions.
__label__neutral	I strongly recommend having lunches early
__label__positive	Thank you very much for such a nice meeting
__label__negative	I guess it would be better not to go into such detail.
__label__positive	She discussed and interacted with soldiers
__label__positive	He is doing an interesting talk
__label__neutral	I never thought about this aspect.
__label__neutral	It’s essential we are prepared.
__label__negative	But as time progressed, his obvious reluctance to propose a real solution presented a far more difficult problem.
__label__negative	I hate practicing on that old equipment.
__label__positive	If all attendees are clear about the objectives and topics to be discussed, the meeting will be better
__label__neutral	Dean presented the facts unemotionally but as soon as he mentioned Scranton, the old man caught the coincidence and could hardly contain himself.
__label__neutral	There we have command and power in their primary form
__label__neutral	I like watching films during presentation, why don’t we see more of them?
__label__negative	He should have faced the existing constrains and react promptly to lack of NDO
__label__negative	After it all I was exhausted.
__label__negative	The place was inappropriate.
__label__positive	You engaged the audience 
__label__negative	At the meeting, the sound was not good
__label__neutral	 It seemed like the commander was hungry
__label__positive	Great project, i’ll keep my fingers crossed for you!
__label__negative	The man spoke in a quiet, but nervous voice.
__label__neutral	The truth is we should promote this Navy-wide.
__label__negative	Breaks are to often.
__label__negative	Women and men should not practice in the same group.
__label__negative	I can see his lack of commitment to job
__label__negative	I would never use such words as the presenter did.
__label__negative	Who proposed this topic for our session?!
__label__negative	I was horrified.
__label__positive	I must say this was amazing!
__label__neutral	I recommend having a better dress by the exhibitors.
__label__neutral	We should have a follow-up of the work meeting
__label__negative	I had an impression that the speaker wasn't sober.
__label__negative	It was a total disaster.
__label__neutral	We should get sth to eat.
__label__negative	He cannot accomplish all of the agenda items during the allotted time
__label__neutral	Maybe we should be given some materials before meetings?
__label__negative	I didn’t like the topic.
__label__neutral	Maybe some materials would help.
__label__negative	 Generally it is thought that the plan was absurd
__label__positive	Starting and finishing on time was appreciated.
__label__positive	The speaker was great as always.
__label__neutral	I remember similar topics covered in speeches during my initial training.
__label__negative	Hopefully, this was his one and only session with drinking too much.
__label__positive	O.K.
__label__negative	With all due respect, this was horrible.
__label__neutral	How can this be achieved in the classroom?
__label__neutral	It should include ending all non-infectious diseases as well.
__label__positive	The didactic content made everything much easier, it was amazing
__label__neutral	They should carry out more activities for public participation
__label__positive	The new pointers were really helpful during the presentation.
__label__neutral	 Generally it is thought that soldiers are nervous
__label__positive	 In my view the commander is calm 
__label__negative	The video of the presentation failed multiple times.
__label__negative	No one has such old machines to practice.
